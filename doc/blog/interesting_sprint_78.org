Time to flush all those tabs again. Some interesting stuff I bumped
into recently-ish.

* Finance, Economics, Politics

- [[https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/marginal-pricing-end-of-western-oil-producers-by-anatole-kaletsky-2015-12][Why Big Oil Should Kill Itself]]: This is a really, really interesting
  article. The gist of it is that the entire logic around oil
  exploration is now a fallacy and it makes more economic sense to
  simply give up looking for oil because all oil that is left is just
  to expensive to commercialise. It also has a very interesting take
  on the valuation of oil companies (and sources of take overs) but I
  won't spoil it for you. If you are into oil (or against it), its a
  must read.

* Startups et al.

- [[https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-wtf-economy][The WTF Economy]]: Tim O'Reilly (of publishing house fame) is setting
  up a conference in the future of work. Sounds extremely
  interesting. Hopefully, they will have a section dedicated to the
  developing world.  Source: Tim O'Reilly (Twitter)
- [[https://medium.com/@jgarzik/bitcoin-is-being-hot-wired-for-settlement-a5beb1df223a#.vn9b7chtk][Bitcoin is Being Hot-Wired for Settlement]]: Garzik is at it
  again. Interesting news of cryptos in the settlement front. Source:

- [[http://www.wired.com/2015/12/elon-musks-billion-dollar-ai-plan-is-about-far-more-than-saving-the-world/?mbid%3Dsocial_fb][Elon Muskâ€™s Billion-Dollar AI Plan Is About Far More Than Saving the
  World]]: So it seems Musk and Altman want to ensure AI plays nice. Not
  quite sure he's right on this one. Steven Levy's version is
  available [[https://medium.com/backchannel/how-elon-musk-and-y-combinator-plan-to-stop-computers-from-taking-over-17e0e27dd02a#.f3ydovlgu][here]], more of an interview with Musk.

* General Coding

- [[https://medium.com/@henrikjohansen/feeding-graph-databases-a-third-use-case-for-modern-log-management-platforms-d5dac8a80d53#.tqmmc91uy][Feeding Graph databases - a third use-case for modern log management
  platforms]]: Very interesting ideas on how to use logging data in a
  graph database. Sounds extremely counter-intuitive, and then you
  start reading at which point its like "Damn, why didn't I think of
  that before!".  Source: Hacker News
- [[http://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i%3D417][Moores law hits the roof]]: Seems like the exponential function is
  revealing itself as a sigmoid, as everyone knew it would. Some of
  the cracks that are already present in Moore's law. Interesting to
  note that a transistor is now only a few silicon atoms wide -
  meaning we can't really make it much smaller. Source: Hacker News

* Databases

- [[http://lwn.net/Articles/667946/][Encrypted databases with ZeroDB]]: I'm not exactly impressed with the
  technology itself, but more with the ideas one can extract from
  it. Briefly: what if the database only stores encrypted data, which
  only each client can decrypt? This is certainly a very useful thing
  for certain types of information and a PostgreSQL extension would
  be most useful. Source: Hacker News

* C++

- [[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q%3Dcache:z7PWAldSxdQJ:sourceforge.net/p/sobjectizer/wiki/Lessons%252520learnt%252520from%25252010%252B%252520years%252520with%252520actors%252520in%252520C%252B%252B/%2B&cd%3D1&hl%3Den&ct%3Dclnk&gl%3Duk][Lessons learnt from 10+ years with actors in C++]]: The voice of
  experience talks about what they learned from using Actors over more
  than a decade. Worth reading if you are into that pattern.
- [[http://blog.scottfrees.com/automating-a-c-program-from-a-node-js-web-app][Automating a C++ program from a Node.js web app]]: If you are
  considering exposing your C++ code into JS, this is a series of
  posts to read.
- [[https://medium.com/swlh/starting-a-tech-startup-with-c-6b5d5856e6de#.tocwuwbe8][Starting a tech startup with C++]]: lots of libraries I never heard of
  and an insight on the performance differences between python and
  c++.
- [[https://medium.com/hacker-daily/writing-high-performance-servers-in-modern-c-7cd00926828#.hksbtpyoh][Writing modern C++ servers using Wangle:]] The follow up to the
  previous post, explaining how to write servers with Facebook
  technologies.

* Layman Science

- [[http://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2015/12/23/why-string-theory-is-not-science/][Why String Theory Is Not A Scientific Theory]]: Doesn't say a lot of
  new things, but its good to remind ourselves on what exactly do we
  mean when we say "Science". This would save us from a lot of grief,
  such as considering Economics as a Science.
- [[https://aeon.co/essays/why-do-scientists-dismiss-the-possibility-of-cold-fusion][The cold fusion horizon]]: ... talking about Science, I was surprised
  to find out that people are still talking seriously about cold
  fusion. Interesting article, because it takes the flip side of the
  Science coin: nothing should /not/ be science unless it is /not/
  using the scientific method. Whilst up til now cold fusion has been
  more of a hoax, we should not discredit people who work on it
  provided they are following scientific principles. Who knows, they
  may be right in the end. Science is all about long-shots.

* Other

- [[http://www.blastr.com/2015-12-23/exit-sandman-neil-gaiman-goes-depth-overture-one-2015s-best-comics][Exit Sandman: Neil Gaiman goes in-depth with Overture, one of 2015's
  best comics]]: For the Sandman fans, the new (and last) Sandman book
  is all the rage. A great interview by the man himself.
