This sprint I found myself making one of those historical transitions:
moving my entire Emacs infrastructure from a old, creaking at the
seams approach, to the new all-singing-all-dancing way of doing
things. This post documents this transition.

* The Road to Cunene

** The Early Days

I have been using [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] since around 1998. One of the biggest reasons
to use Emacs is its infinite configurability. To call Emacs
"configurable" is a bit like saying [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler][Euler]] wasn't bad with numbers. In
truth - and it takes you a while to really grok this - Emacs is just a
lisp platform with a _giant_ editing library built on top; a library
that keeps on getting extended on a daily basis by a large number of
Emacs users. And, of course, you configure Emacs using lisp, so that
the lines between "configuration" and "development" are, at best,
blurry.

But lets go back to the beginning. Like every other Emacs newbie in
those days, I too started with a plain (i.e. non-configured) Emacs and
soon evolved to a very simple _[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InitFile][.emacs]]_ - this file being one of the
possible places in which to store its configuration. The reason why
almost all Emacs users start configuring Emacs very early on is
because its defaults are astonishingly atrocious. It still amazes me
to the day that some people are able to use plain Emacs and come out
at the other end as Emacs users. In some ways, I guess it is a test of
fire: do you _really_ want to use Emacs? There are two responses to
this test: most give up, but a few persist and soon start changing the
editor to behave in a slightly more sane manner.

The _.emacs_ starts small, especially if you are not familiar with
lisp. Sooner or later it occurs to you that, _surely_, someone must
have already done one of these before, and then you find the amazing
world of _.emacs_ "development". This opens up entire new vistas of
the Emacs landscape, because with each _.emacs_ you find, you discover
untold numbers of configuration knobs and - much more importantly -
many new _modes_ to install. In Emacs lingo, a _mode_ is kind of like
a "plug-in" for Eclipse or Visual Studio users. But this is just an
approximation; as with everything "Emacs", there is actually no real
equivalent way of describing Emacs terminology with analogies outside
of Emacs. The problem with IDEs and most other editors is that they
can only be extended in ways that their designers thought useful. In
Emacs, _everything_ is extensible. And I do mean _everything_. I
remember the day I realised that a key press was really just the
invocation of the =self-insert-command= function and, like any other
function, it too could be changed in a myriad of ways.

But I digress. As with most users, my _.emacs_ evolved over the years
as I found more and more modes. I soon found that it was very painful
to keep all my machines with the same setup; invariably I would change
something at work but forget to change it at home or Uni or
vice-versa. To make matters worse, work was on Windows. And in those
days, there was no Emacs package management support, so you ended up
copying lots of modes around. Life was painful and brute in my first
decade of Emacs.

** The Cunene Years

Around six years ago, things got a lot better: I started to use git in
anger, refactored my _.emacs_ into something slightly saner and called
it Cunene - after [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunene_River][the river]] in Southern Angola. Eventually I [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/cunene][put it on
GitHub]]. I believe - but don't recall exactly - that most of the
refactoring ideas were stolen from Phil Hagelberg's [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][Starter Kit]].

Whatever the source of ideas, the improvements were undeniable. Cunene
offered a all-in-one place to go to for my _.emacs_, and it combined
all the experience I had in seeing other people's _.emacs_. At over
twenty megs it wasn't exactly svelte, but my objective was to have a
"zero-conf" setup; given a new machine, all I wanted to do was to =git
clone= cunene, start Emacs and have exactly the same environment as
everywhere else.

Further, I could update Cunene from any machine and push it back to
GitHub. Cunene contained all the modes I needed, at trusted versions
and with some (very minor) patches. I could easily upgrade one or more
modes from one machine and then just =git pull= from all other
machines. It also handled the Windows-specific workarounds, to ensure
things worked well out of the box there too.

To be fair, for the last 6 years, this setup has served me well. But
time also revealed its limitations:

- package management support was limited. I tried using [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA][Elpa]] but at
  the time, not that many packages were available; package management
  had evolved in leaps and bounds but we were stuck with our ages-old
  Elpa support.
- the accumulation of modes over such a long period meant that
  starting Emacs took quite a long time. And to make matters worse,
  only a small percentage of the modes were truly useful.
- most of the modes were at stale versions. Since things worked for
  me, I had no incentive to keep up with latest and greatest - and for
  all the easiness, it was still not exactly trivial to upgrade
  modes. This meant that I ended up having to put up with bugs that
  had long been fixed in HEAD, and worse, whenever I upgraded to
  latest, I saw massive changes in behaviour.
- I was stuck on Emacs 23. For whatever reason, some parts of Cunene
  did not work with Emacs 24 properly and I was never able to get to
  the bottom of this. Being on an old version of Emacs has been a
  problem because I make use of C++-11 but Emacs 23 doesn't really
  indent it properly.
- Cunene had a lot of boilerplate code. Since I never really learnt
  how to code in Emacs lisp, I was most likely writing a lot of
  non-idiomatic code. Also, the Emacs API has moved on considerably in
  fifteen years.
- Cedet and Org-mode are now part of Emacs but we were still carrying
  our own copies. I never managed to get Cedet to work properly
  either.
- many new modes have appeared of late that provide much better
  solutions, but Cunene insulated me from these developments. In
  addition, adding new modes would only add to the complexity so I had
  no incentive to do so. A classic example is Flycheck; whilst I used
  Flymake in anger quite a lot, and could not live without it, the
  truth was that some of its limitations were truly crippling. For
  example, sometimes I had to wait tens of seconds to get a buffer to
  update.

There had to be a better way of doing things; something that combined
the advantages of Cunene but fixed its shortcomings.

 Then I heard of [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude#automated][Prelude]].

* The Road to Prelude

** What is Prelude and Why Do I Like It

According to the official documentation:

#+begin_quote
Prelude is an Emacs distribution that aims to enhance the default
Emacs experience. Prelude alters a lot of the default settings,
bundles a plethora of additional packages and adds its own core
library to the mix. The final product offers an easy to use Emacs
configuration for Emacs newcomers and lots of additional power for
Emacs power users.
#+end_quote

I am still finding my way around - so don't quote me - but from what I
have seen, it seems to me that Prelude is like the Cunene "framework"
but done by people that know what they are doing. It covers all of the
advantages described above, but shares none of its disadvantages. In
particular:

- it provides a sensible set of baseline defaults that "we all can
  agree on". I found it quite surprising that a plain Prelude looked
  almost like Cunene. Of course, no two Emacs users agree on anything,
  really, so there is still a lot to be tweaked. Having said that, the
  great thing is you can start by seeing what Prelude says and giving
  it a good go using it; if the baseline default does not work for
  you, you can always override it. Just because you have been doing
  something in a certain way for a long time does not mean its the
  best way, and the move to Prelude provides an opportunity to
  reevaluate a lot of "beliefs".
- all the framework code is now shared by a large number of Emacs
  users. This means it is well designed and maintained, and all you
  have to worry about is your small extensibility points. With over 1k
  forks in GitHub you can rest assured that Prelude will be around for
  a long time. In addition, if you find yourself changing something
  that is useful to the Prelude community, you can always submit a
  pull request and have that code shared with the community. You no
  longer have to worry about staleness or non-idiomatic code.
- Prelude integrates nicely with several package managers and handles
  updates for you.
- There are lots of examples of Prelude users - you just need to
  follow the GitHub forks. It would be nice to have a list of "good
  examples" though, because at 1K forks its not easy to locate
  those. This article will link to any forks that I found particularly
  useful as a source of ideas.
- If you fork Prelude the right way, you should be able to update from
  upstream frequently without having too many conflicts. I am still
  getting my head around this, but the model seems sound at first
  blush.

But to know if it worked required using it in anger.

** From Cunene to Prelude

Emacs users are creatures of habit and changing your entire workflow
is not something to take lightly. Having said that, I always find that
the best way to do it is to just go for it. After all, you can always
go back to how you did things before. In addition, I did not want to
do a wholesale port of Cunene for two reasons:

- I didn't want to bring across any bad habits when Prelude was
  already solving a problem properly.
- I wanted to get rid of all of the accumulated cruft that was no
  longer useful.

What follows are my notes on the porting work.

*** Initial Setup

Prelude recommends you to create a fork and then add to it your
personal configuration. I decided to create a branch in which to store
the personal configuration rather than pollute master. This has two
advantages:

- pulling from upstream will always be conflictless;
- if I do decide to submit a pull request in the future, I can have a
  clean feature branch off of master that doesn't have any of the
  personal cruft in it.

#+begin_quote
As it happens, I later found out that other Prelude users also use
this approach such as [[https://github.com/danielwuz][Daniel Wu]], as you can see [[https://github.com/danielwuz/prelude/tree/personal/personal][here]]. I ended up using
Daniel's approach in quite a few cases.
#+end_quote

I created [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/prelude][my prelude fork]] in GitHub using the web interface. Once the
fork was ready, I moved Cunene out of the way by renaming the existing
=.emacs.d= directory and performed the following setup:

#+begin_example
$ curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh -o installer.sh
$ chmod +x installer.sh
$ ./installer.sh -s git@github.com:mcraveiro/prelude.git
#+end_example

This created a Prelude-based =~/.emacs.d=, cloned off of my fork. I
then setup upstream:

#+begin_example
$ cd ~/.emacs.d
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:bbatsov/prelude.git
#+end_example

This means I can now get latest from upstream by simply doing:

#+begin_example
$ git checkout master
$ git pull upstream master
$ git push origin master
#+end_example

I then setup the =personal= branch:

#+begin_example
 $ git branch --track personal origin/personal
 $ git branch
   master
 * personal
#+end_example

For good measure, I also setup =personal= to be the default branch in
GitHub. This hopefully means there is one less configuration step when
setting up new machines. Once all of that was done, I got ready to
start Emacs 24. The version in Debian Testing at present is 24.4.1 -
not quite the latest (24.5 is out) but recent enough for those of us
stuck in 23.

The start-up was a bit slow; Prelude downloaded a number of packages,
taking perhaps a couple of minutes and eventually was ready. For good
measure I closed Emacs and started it again; the restart took a few
seconds, which was quite pleasing. I was ready to start exploring
Prelude.

*** The "Editor" Configuration

My first step in configuration was to create a =init.el= file under
=.emacs.d/personal= and add =prelude-personal-editor.el=. I decided to
follow this naming convention by looking at the Prelude core
directory; seems vaguely in keeping. This file will be used for a
number of minor tweaks that are not directly related to an obvious
major mode (at least from a layman's perspective).

**** Fonts, Colours and Related Cosmetics

The first thing I found myself tweaking was the default colour
theme. Whilst I actually quite like [[https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs][Zenburn]], I find I need a black
background and my font of choice. After consulting a number of
articles such as [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20781746/emacs-prelude-background-color][Emacs Prelude: Background Color]] and the [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/SetFonts][Emacs Wiki]], I
decided to go with this approach:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; set the current frame background and font.
(set-background-color "black")
(set-frame-font "Inconsolata Bold 16" nil t)

;; set the font and background for all other frames.
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist
             '(background-color . "black")
             '(font .  "Inconsolata Bold 16"))
#+end_src

The font works like a charm, but for some reason the colour gets reset
during start-up. On the plus side, new frames are setup correctly. I
have raised an issue with Prelude: [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/issues/855][What is the correct way to update
the background colour in personal configuration?]] For now there is
nothing for it but to update the colour manually. Since I don't
restart Emacs very often this is not an urgent problem.

One pleasing thing was to find that font-lock is already global so no
need for any additional settings there.

**** Widgets and Related Cosmetics

Pleasantly, Prelude already excludes a lot of annoying artefacts and
it also already comes with mouse wheel support out of the box, which
is nice. All and all, a large number of options where already setup
the way I like it:

- no splash screen;
- no menu-bars or tool-bars;
- good frame title format with the buffer name;
- no annoying visible bell;
- displaying of column and line numbers, as well as size of buffers
  out of the box;
- not only search had highlight, but the all shiny [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-anzu][Anzu mode]] is even
  niftier!
- no need for hacks like =fontify-frame=.

However, it includes scroll-bars and tool-tips which I do not use
since I like to stick to the keyboard. It also didn't have date and
time in the mode line; and for good measure, I disabled clever
window splitting as I found it a pain in the past. Having said that, I
am still not 100% happy with time and date since it consumes a lot of
screen real estate. This will be revisited in the context of [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiminishedModes][diminish]]
and other mode line helpers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; disable scroll bar
(scroll-bar-mode -1)

;; disable tool tips
(when window-system
  (tooltip-mode -1))

;; time and date
(setq display-time-24hr-format t)
(setq display-time-day-and-date t)
(display-time)
#+end_src

One note on line highlighting. Whilst I quite like this feature in
select places such as grep and dired, I am not a fan of using it
globally like Prelude does. However, I decided to give it a try and
disable it later if it becomes too annoying.

**** Tabs, Spaces, Newlines and Indentation

In the realm of "spacing", Prelude scores well:

- no silly adding of new lines when scrolling down, or asking when
  adding a new line at save;
- pasting performs indentation automatically (yank indent etc)-
  default handling of tabs and spaces is fairly sensible - except for
  the eight spaces for a tab! A few minor things are missing such as
  =untabify-buffer=. These may warrant a pull request at some point in
  the near future.
- a nice whitespace mode which is not quite the same as I had it in
  Cunene but seems to be equally as capable so I'll stick to it.

**** To Prompt or Not to Prompt

There are a few cases where me and Prelude are at odds when it comes
to prompts. First, I seem to try to exit Emacs by mistake and I do
that _a lot_. As any heavy Emacs user will tell you, there is nothing
more annoying than exiting Emacs by mistake (if fact, when else do you
exit Emacs?). I normally have more than 50 buffers open and not only
does it take forever to bring up Emacs with that much state, but it
never quite comes back up exactly the way I left it. Anyway, suffices
to say that I strongly believe in the "are you sure you want to exit
Emacs" prompt, so I had that copied over from Cunene. And, of course,
one does not like typing "yes" when "y" suffices:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Make all "yes or no" prompts show "y or n" instead
(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

;; confirm exit
(global-set-key
 (kbd "C-x C-c")
 '(lambda ()
    (interactive)
    (if (y-or-n-p-with-timeout "Do you really want to exit Emacs ?" 4 nil)
        (save-buffers-kill-emacs))))
#+end_src

There is a nice touch in Prelude enabling a few disabled modes such as
upper/down casing of regions - or perhaps the powers that be changed
that for Emacs 24. Whoever is responsible, its certainly nice not to
have to worry about it.

**** Keybindings

One of the biggest cultural shocks, inevitably, happened with
keybindings. I am giving Prelude the benefit of the doubt - even
though my muscle memory is not happy at all. The following has proved
annoying:

- Apparently arrow keys are discouraged. Or so I keep hearing in my
  minibuffer every time I press one. As it happens, the warnings are
  making me press them less.
- C-b was my ido key. However, since I should really not be using the
  arrow keys, I had to use the slightly more standard C-x b.
- Eassist include/implementation toggling was mapped to M-o and M-i
  was my quick way of opening includes in semantic (more on that
  later). However, these bindings don't seem to work any more.
- pc-select is a bit screwed in some modes such as C++ and Emacs
  lisp. But that's alright since you shouldn't be using the arrow keys
  right? What is annoying is that it works ok'ish in Org-mode so I
  find that I behave differently depending on the mode I'm on.
- in addition, win-move is using the default shift-arrow keys and its
  not setup to handle multiple frames. This is a problem as I always
  have a few frames. These will have to be changed, if nothing else
  just to preserve my sanity.
- talking about pc-select, I still find myself pasting with C-v. Just
  can't help it, its years of muscle memory. It is rather
  disconcerting to see your screen move up when you do, makes you
  think your paste has totally screwed up the buffer when in reality
  its just the old muscle memory biting again.

All and all, after a few days the muscle memory seems to have adapted
well enough. I'm hoping I'll soon be able to use C-b and C-f without
thinking, like a real Emacs user.

*** Modes From Cunene

Unfortunately, package management was not quite as complete as I had
hoped and so, yet again, I ended up with a number of modes that had to
be copied into git. Fortunately these are a lot less in number. I
decided to place them under [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/prelude/tree/personal/personal/vendor][personal/vendor]] as I wasn't sure what
vendor was for.

**** Cedet

After almost losing my mind trying to configure Cedet from Emacs 24, I
decided to bite the bullet and upgrade to the latest development
version. In the past this was a safe bet; I'm afraid to report it
still is the best way to get Cedet up and running. In fact, I got it
working within minutes after updating to develop versus a whole day of
fighting against the built-in version. Pleasantly, it is now available
in git:

: git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/cedet/git cedet

Building it was a simple matter of calling make, both at the top-level
and in contrib:

#+begin_example
$ cd cedet
$ make EMACS=emacs24
$ cd contrib
$ make EMACS=emacs24
#+end_example

The setup was directly copied from their INSTALL document, so I
recommend reading that.

In terms of Cedet, a very large win was the move to [[https://github.com/randomphrase/ede-compdb][EDE Compilation
Database]]. I really cannot even begin to explain the joys of this mode,
it is truly wonderful. I did the tiniest of changes to my build
process by defining an extra macro:

: cmake ../../../dogen -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=TRUE

With just that - and a couple of lisp incantations (see the [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/prelude/blob/personal/personal/init-cedet.el#L78][cedet init
file]]) - and suddenly I stopped having to worry about supplying flags
to flymake (well, _flycheck_ - but that's another story!), semantic,
the whole shebang. I haven't quite worked out all of the details just
yet, but with very little configuration the compilation database seems
to just get everything working.

Because of this, this means I am now finding myself using Cedet a lot
more; the intelisense seems to just work on the majority of cases. The
only annoyance is the annoyance of old of having Emacs block on
occasion whilst building some semantic database or other. Which gave
me the idea of [[http://sourceforge.net/p/cedet/mailman/message/34145936/][replacing it]] with a Clang based "semantic database
generator". Lets see what the Cedet mailinglist says about it.

All and all, Cedet is much improved from the olden days. I will post a
proper review after a month or so of using it in anger.

**** Git-emacs

Git-emacs makes me a bit sad. In truth, I am a perfectly content magit
user (more on that later) except for _one_ feature - the file status
"dot". This is something I got used from the svn days and still find
it quite useful. Its silly really, especially in these days of
[[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter][git-gutter]], but I still like to know if there have been any changes to
a file or not, and I haven't found a good way of doing this outside of
git-emacs. It provides a nice little red or green dot in the modeline,
like so:


However, there are no packaged versions of git-emacs and since
everyone uses magit these days, I can't see it making to Elpa. Also,
it is rather annoying having to load the whole of git-emacs for a dot,
but there you go.

*** Modes From Prelude or Emacs 24

In this section

**** Dired



- shows hidden files by default.

https://truongtx.me/2013/04/24/dired-as-default-file-manager-3-dired-details/

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default dired-omit-mode t)
(setq-default dired-omit-files "^\\.?#\\|^\\.$\\|^\\.\\.$\\|^\\.")
#+end_src

- Nice touch is that copying directories recursively doesn't ask you
  for permission and if there is a dired buffer already opened in the
  screen, the destination defaults to that directory.



*** New Modes

- undo tree
