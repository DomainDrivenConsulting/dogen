*** Mix-and-match of manual types

When adding types manually one needs to add a regex to get dogen to
ignore these files. This works but it means dogen does not add these
files to the includers. A better solution would be to add a stereotype
of =manual= which would result in automatic ignoring of files for
these types as well as adding them to includers.
