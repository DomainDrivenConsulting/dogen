*** IMPLEMENTATION Re-implement key support                           :story:

- create a new stereotype of keyed. when set, it results in the
  creation of a new class containing all properties marked as
  identity. if none are found, throw. only entities can be keyed.
- create new stand alone function =extract_key=. given an instance of
  a class, it returns the corresponding key. it should be defined in
  the same file as the key.
- if versioned, also create unversioned key class. add typedefs in
  class for versioned key.

Rules:

- entities must have at least one KEY_ATTRIBUTE
- keyed pods must be entities.
- unversioned keyed entities will have unversioned keys.
- versioned keyed entities will have versioned keys.
- values can be versioned.

**** IMPLEMENTATION Propagate key attribute to SML
**** Ensure entities have at least one key attribute defined
**** Unhook key generation from entity stereotype

Instead of generating versioned/unversioned keys, it should just force
the user to define at least one attribute with  property of
identity.

**** Hook key generation to keyed stereotype
**** Only define versioned key if versioned stereotype is present

*** Use explicit casting for versioned to unversioned conversions     :story:
    CLOCK: [2012-11-22 Thu 08:44]--[2012-11-22 Thu 09:20] =>  0:36

At present we have to_versioned; in reality this would be dealt much
better using explicit casts:

: explicit operator std::string() { return "explicit"; }

Actually the real solution for this is to make the versioned key
contain the unversioned key; then dogen will generate all the
required code.

At this point in time we do not have enough use cases to make the
correct design decisions in this area. We need to wait until we start
using keys in anger in Creris and then design the API around the use
cases.

*** Move all of the versioning, entity, key tests to stereotypes      :story:

- remove versioning from all other models such as std::model, etc.
- add tests for =std::unordered=, maps etc.
