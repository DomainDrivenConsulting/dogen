Assets is the core Dogen meta-model representing software entities.

@section assets_0 Overview

Assets is a meta-model that strives to provide a technical-space
agnostic type representation, designed for code generation. Injection
models are obtained via frontends and transformed into "bare" asset
models, at which point they can enter its pipeline. Within it, they
are processed until they form a cohesive whole. They are then in a
suitable state for code generation.

@section asset_1 Mission

The objectives of the assets model are:

- to represent all high-level entities that exist across a number of
  technical spaces used in software engineering. These entities are
  not necessarily limited to programming entities, though, of course,
  these form the core set of elements we're interested in. Additional
  entities such as build systems and high-level patterns such as GoF
  and others are also captured.
- to provide the tooling required to combine multiple models together
  into a bigger model - called the /merged/ model.
- to ensure the consistency of the merged model via validation rules
  (such as verifying that all types have a definitions, etc.).

Contains the core meta-model entities that make up the assets mode.

    :end:

Represents an attribute in an object.

**** id                                                           :operation:

Returns the identity of this object.

#+begin_src cpp
int id();
#+end_src

***** masd.generation.cpp.types.class_implementation

    return qualified().test();
}

    :dogen:
    :masd.injection.type: std::string
    :end:

Original type name as it appeared in the source, without any parsing.

Name must be in one of the supported notations.
