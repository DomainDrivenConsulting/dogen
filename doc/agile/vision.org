* About

This document defines what we consider to be the [[http://www.scaledagileframework.com/vision/][the vision]] for Dogen;
what guides us when we think about the product.

* Vision Statement

The vision for Dogen is:

- To create a suite of code generation tools that useful to developers
  in multiple programming languages, and integrated with IDEs and text
  editors;
- To make this suite extensible, such that users can come up with uses
  for it far different than anything we envisioned.
