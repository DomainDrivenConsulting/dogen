* About

This document defines what we consider to be the [[http://www.scaledagileframework.com/vision/][the vision]] for Dogen;
what guides us when we think about the product.

* Vision Statement

The vision for Dogen is:

- To create a suite of code generation tools targeting model
  generation;
- for these tools to be useful to developers in multiple programming
  languages, and to be designed to be integrated with IDEs and text
  editors;
- To make this suite extensible, such that users can come up with
  modifications suited to their particular domain.
