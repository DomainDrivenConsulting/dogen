* About

This document defines what we consider to be the [[http://www.scaledagileframework.com/vision/][the vision]] for Dogen;
what guides us when we think about the product.

* Vision Statement

The vision for Dogen is:

- to create a suite of code generation tools targeting model and
  product generation, according to a well-specified product line;
- for these tools to have the potential to be useful to developers in
  multiple programming languages, and to be designed to be integrated
  with IDEs and text editors;
- to make the suite extensible, such that users can come up with
  modifications suited to their particular domain.

* Vision Quotes

- code that can be reduced to an heuristic must be codegened; code
  that cannot, must be helped.
