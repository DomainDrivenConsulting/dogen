Updates to sprint and product backlog.

*** STARTED Updates to the manual and readme files                    :story:

Use downtime to update the manual and / or readme file.

*** COMPLETED Fix borked gcc build                                    :story:

The last few builds on travis have failed. Figure out why and fix it.

*** Output new world forward declarations                             :story:

We need to find a way to suppress class header formatter and enable
forward declarations formatter; we want to start using new code from
now on.

*** Contents change check is done twice                               :story:

We seem to check twice if a file has changed:

: 2015-04-26 12:37:28.451464 [DEBUG] [formatters.filesystem_writer] File contents have not changed, and force write is false so not writing.
: 2015-04-26 12:37:28.451486 [DEBUG] [formatters.filesystem_writer] File contents have not changed, and force write is false so not writing.

This is in stitch but it should be the same for knit.

*** Stitch does not handle directories very well                      :story:

At present we seem to generate log files called =.= when we use stitch
against a directory. This should only happen if we use =.= on the
target parameter, e.g.:

: --target .

Not sure why it is happening when we call stitch from CMake since it
should use the full path to the =cpp= directory.

*** Update dynamic section in manual                                  :story:

We need to talk about the new fields, field templates, etc.

*** Add stitch section in manual                                      :story:

We need to document stitch:

- formal definition of the language and its limitations;
- command line usage of the tool.

*** Add kvp support to =identifier_parser=                            :story:

We have code to split kvps all over the place. We should do this in a
single pace, and use boost spirit or tokenizer. For one such
implementation with spirit see:
