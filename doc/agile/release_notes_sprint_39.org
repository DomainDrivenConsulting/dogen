*** IMPLEMENTATION Release notes and backlog grooming                  :task:
    CLOCK: [2013-11-19 Tue 21:38]--[2013-11-19 Tue 21:49] =>  0:11
    CLOCK: [2013-11-19 Tue 07:56]--[2013-11-19 Tue 08:02] =>  0:06

*** IMPLEMENTATION Finish indexer class and plug it to SML workflow   :story:

Create a class called =indexer=, responsible for taking in a merged
model and populating the index property of all things Indexable. Move
code from =extrator= and =transformer= (leaf processing) into
=indexer=.

**** IMPLEMENTATION Add indexing support for concepts properly
     CLOCK: [2013-11-20 Wed 18:10]--[2013-11-20 Wed 18:56] =>  0:46
     CLOCK: [2013-11-20 Wed 07:53]--[2013-11-20 Wed 08:41] =>  0:48
     CLOCK: [2013-11-19 Tue 21:50]--[2013-11-19 Tue 23:03] =>  1:13

We missed refinement expansion.

**** IMPLEMENTATION Finish adding unit tests for modeled concepts      :task:
     CLOCK: [2013-11-19 Tue 17:42]--[2013-11-19 Tue 18:24] =>  0:42
     CLOCK: [2013-11-19 Tue 08:06]--[2013-11-19 Tue 08:40] =>  0:34

**** Add unit tests for the indexing of properties                     :task:
**** Add unit tests for the indexing of relationships                  :task:

**** Plug indexer into workflow                                        :task:
**** Update transformer to populate basic relationships                :task:
**** Implement indexing of associations, keys and visitor              :task:
*** Replace existing structures with indexing ones                    :story:

Make use of the indexing information in legacy C++ formatters as a way
to validate that it is correct.

**** Create a helper class to handle relationships                     :task:

- =find_relationship=: gets a specific relationship container, returns
  empty if it does not exist.
- =find_relationship_strict=: gets a specific relationship container,
  throws if it does not exist.

**** Replace original parent/parent functionality with relationships   :task:

- delete leaves, original parent, parent attributes and use
  relationships instead.

**** Replace the concepts expansion code with relationships            :task:
**** Replace C++ property handling code with relationships             :task:
**** Replace association, keys and visitor with relationships          :task:

*** Add include file support to main type formatter                   :story:

Inclusion support needs to be moved to the formatters. SML provides
all the required information at the model level in terms of type
dependencies, but only the formatter itself knows what includes it
needs because these are related to the implementation. Even
determining which facets of a type one should include is formatter
dependent. We need to distribute the logic of the includer into each
formatter.
