Steps to create a new release.

* Close previous sprint

To be done on the last Sunday of the sprint.

1. Make a copy of current sprint backlog and name it current
   sprint + 1 but don't check it in.
2. Move all untouched stories into product backlog.
3. Close current sprint: close all open tasks, delete tasks we did not
   work on, update clocks.
4. Push commit and wait for builds. This ensures that if there are any
   failures you can fix them before the release tag.
4. Tag commit and sign it with key.
5. Push tag. You can generate new builds overnight.

* Open new sprint

To be done on the Monday morning of the new sprint.

1. Open new sprint, updating CMake version, README, appveyor version
   and decoration formatter tests. This should all be in one
   commit. *DO NOT PUSH*.
2. Regenerate the LAM models for C# and C++ with the new version, and
   commit the changed files. Push the commit. (Ensure there are no
   pending builds still running or tests will fail due to version
   change).
3. Create a demo. Publish it on youtube.
4. Write up release notes, publish them in github.
5. Download the binaries from bin tray and manually upload them to github.
6. Update bintray with the correct release notes.
7. When tag build is finished, announce on gitter, twitter and linked
   in.
