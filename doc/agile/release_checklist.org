#+title: Release Checklist
#+options: date:nil toc:nil author:nil num:nil

Steps to create a new release:

1. Move all untouched stories into product backlog.
2. Close current sprint: close all open tasks, delete tasks we did not
   work on, update clocks.
3. Tag commit and sign it with key.
4. Make a copy of current sprint backlog and name it current
   sprint + 1.
5. Open new sprint, updating CMake version, README and appveyor
   version. This should all be in one commit.
6. Write up release notes, publish them in github.
7. When tag build is finished, announce on gitter, twitter and linked
   in.
8. Update bintray with the correct release notes.
