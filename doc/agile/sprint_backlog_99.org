Title: Dogen v0.98.0, "Santo Adrião"

#+begin_src markdown
![alt text](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QN04x6AzKRw/S3GrWbya3EI/AAAAAAAASdo/UiHYehVmWQE/s640/Igreja.jpg)
Igreja de Santo Adrião, Namibe, Angola. (C) Blog Moçâmedes Saudade, in [blogspot](http://mocamedes-saudade.blogspot.co.uk/2007/05/blog-post_2275.html).

Overview
=======
As with the previous sprint, this sprint was also a smuttering of unrelated commits, attempting to address problems we are facing in production at present. However a main theme emerged: major improvements in the ODB support.

This was spurned by the ongoing series of blogposts on the integration of ODB with Dogen, using Oracle as the RDBMS:

- [Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part I](http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html)
- [Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part II](http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with_24.html)

The purpose of these series of posts is to give Dogen's ORM functionality a through testing to ensure its good enough for production. The end result will be an update to the Database test model.

Finally, we also took the chance to clean up the multiple test models we had in C++, and coalesced a number of them into a single, unified test model for C++, along the lines of what we had done for C#.

User visible changes
===============
In this sprint, a small number of user visible changes were made:

- **ODB Fixes**: a number of small fixes in the ODB support were performed, including fixing the CMake targets.
- **Introduction of the ORM layer**: We create a layer of indirection between Dogen and ODB, allowing users to configure the object-relational mapping in "generic terms". This has the side-effect of greatly reducing the number of manual ODB pragmas required, because Dogen can now infer a lot of information from the meta-data supplied.
- **Log directory is now configurable**: You can now send the Dogen logs to a directory of your choosing, making Dogen easier to integrate with existing builds, which may already have their own log directory.

For more details of the work carried out this sprint, see the [sprint log](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/sprint_backlog_98.org).

Next Sprint
========
The next sprint will continue to focus on ODB and Visual Studio support.

Binaries
======
You can download experimental binaries from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/domaindrivenconsulting/Dogen) for OSX, Linux and Windows (all 64-bit):

*** STARTED Add test model for path meta-data                         :story:
    CLOCK: [2017-03-06 Mon 20:21]--[2017-03-06 Mon 20:35] =>  0:14
    CLOCK: [2017-03-06 Mon 20:05]--[2017-03-06 Mon 20:20] =>  0:15

    CLOCK: [2017-03-06 Mon 17:02]--[2017-03-06 Mon 18:02] =>  1:00

We are making use of directory and file settings, but we do not have
any tests for it. Add a simple test model that exercises all settings
in one go (at least those that are not mutually exclusive).

*** STARTED Build on tags for Windows                                 :story:
    CLOCK: [2017-03-06 Mon 12:01]--[2017-03-06 Mon 12:16] =>  0:15

At present we are not building and deploying for tags on Windows. This
is a major pain because it means we must remember to always push the
tag separately. We need to setup appveyor correctly.

Links:

- [[http://help.appveyor.com/discussions/problems/6209-build-is-not-triggered-for-tag][Build is not triggered for tag]]

*** STARTED Add a "flat directory" mode                               :story:
    CLOCK: [2017-03-06 Mon 14:31]--[2017-03-06 Mon 14:39] =>  0:08

It would be nice to have a mode in which all files get placed in a
single-directory: no src, include, etc – just one big folder with all
files.

Actually we can already achieve this:

- set =quilt.cpp.disable_facet_directories= to true
- set =quilt.cpp.include_directory_name= to empty
- set =source_directory_name= to empty

It is however a bit painful. It would be nice to have a shorthand for
this, which could be the "flat directory" mode. It is also compatible
with split project mode (we just have flat directories in two
different top-level directories), which is nice.

We should check that =enable_unique_file_names= is set to true.

*** STARTED Split include and source directories                      :story:
    CLOCK: [2017-03-06 Mon 16:30]--[2017-03-06 Mon 17:01] =>  0:31

We removed a feature due to lack of use cases: splitting source and
include directories. It allowed having them placed in different
top-level directories. It also meant that the computation of managed
directories required access to the root object. In case we need to
reactivate this story (if we find a use case), we keep track of the
commits that removed the feature here.

- [[https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/commit/6103de47af5fc7d33710b216cac0fb1943416448][remove support for split projects]]

This will be implemented slightly differently this time round
though. Instead of a "split project" option and two additional options
for include and source, we'll just add a new option for include:

: output-cpp-include-dir

If present, it will be used for the c++ include directory. If not
present, the behaviour will remain as is. We can propagate this
information all the way to the locator, where it will do the right
thing.

Merged stories:

*Handling of include cmakelists in split projects is not correct*

At present we are only generating a cmakelists file for include
folders on non-split projects. This means that the header files for
split projects won't be packaged up. It also means that for ODB
projects we won't get the ODB targets.

*** Add =targetver.h= support                                         :story:

On windows we should be generating the targetver header.

Links:

- [[https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/blob/master/Samples/RadialController/cpp/targetver.h][targetver.h]]

*** Add support for DLL Main on windows                               :story:

At present we are manually generating DLL Main by hand and then
excluding it on regexes. This is not ideal and will be more of a
problem when we generate project files. Ideally we should code
generate it. Requirements:

- user must be able to disable it;
- user must be able to handcraft it in case they want different
  contents;

Links:

- [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370448(v%3Dvs.85).aspx][DLL Main]]

*** Add support for pre-compiled headers on windows                   :story:

Most VS users have pre-compiled headers. We need to generate
=stdafx.h= etc. For now we can have it minimally populated until we
understand better the requirements.

Actually we could probably do a very simple computation in quilt to
figure out the most frequently used headers and add those to
=stdafx=. We just need to go through the entire model in the inclusion
expander to perform this calculation.

In addition we need to make sure =stdafx= is added as the first
include.

We should have a quilt setting for pre-compilation. We should also
check that visual studio support is enabled in order to generate
=stdafx=.

*** Add support for Visual Studio C++ projects                        :story:

Visual studio project needs the files to be listed by hand. We can
either generate the project or the user has to manually add the
files. This is a problem every time they change. Requirements:

- we need to be able to support multiple VS versions as well (user
  configurable)
- user may want to import property sheets
- need guids (as per C# projects)
- need additional library/include directories
- need to add pre-compiled headers support with /FI.
- add a solution for good measure, using the C# code.
- add filter files for headers and source files.

As per ODB, users may also want to build with different versions of
VS. We should allow generating more than one solution and postfix them
with the VS version.

We should also generate filters for the project:

- header files
- source files
- ODB header files
- ODB source files

The inclusion of ODB files must be done using regular expressions
because we do not want to have to do two passes for knit; so we don't
really know what files are available. However, if the ODB files have a
=cxx= extension, we can just =CLInclude= =*cxx=.

Links:

- [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2208a1f2.aspx][Project Files]]

*** Add a top-level "Visual Studio" knob                              :story:

We have a number of features that only make sense when on Windows and
building for Visual Studio. We should have a top-level knob that
enables or disables all of these features in one go:

- =quilt.cpp.visual_studio.enabled=

*** Add C++-03 mode                                                    :epic:

#+begin_quote
*Story*: As a dogen user, I want to create models in C++ 03 so that I
can interface with legacy code.
#+end_quote

It shouldn't be too hard to generate C++-03 code in addition to
C++-14. We could follow the gcc/odb convention and have a =-std=
option for this in meta-data. The only problem would be testing - at
present the language settings comes from cmake, and we'd have to make
sure the compiler is not in C++-14 mode when compiling test models
in 03. Also, the mixing and matching of 03 with 14 may not be
trivial. We should wait for a use case.

It may be possible to add different flags to different projects in
CMake.

We should call this the c++ dialect.

Tasks:

- default ctors, final, noexcept. Need to manually add default
  ctor (e.g. force it).
- enums
- need to disable ODB c++ 11 as well.

*** Handcrafted support for fabric types                              :story:

At present we can either disable fabric types or enable them
(CMakeLists, etc). However, there is a third common use case: to
handcraft them. To do this we normally disable them and then add the
file to the ignore list:

:  --ignore-files-matching-regex .*/CMakeLists.txt)

One could conceive of some meta-data support that would make this
process a tad easier and more generic:

: quilt.cpp.cmakelists.stereotypes=handcrafted

Then hopefully the existing pipeline would take over and we'd generate
the files for the first time but then let the user overwrite it. This
would also be applicable to all fabric types (registrar, etc) but we'd
have to manually read each stereotype on each factory.

*** Use =cxx= extension with ODB files                                :story:

At present we renamed the ODB extension to =.cpp=. This is to make the
ODB files part of the project:

: set(files "")
: file(GLOB_RECURSE files RELATIVE
:    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/"
:    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/*.cpp")

However, it's quite nice to have distinct extensions for ODB and Dogen
files. We should add a conditional in CMake that detects ODB and if
found adds:

: set(odb_files "")
: file(GLOB_RECURSE odb_files RELATIVE
:    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/"
:    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/*.cxx")
: set(files ${files} ${odb_files})

*** Clean up annotation scope types                                   :story:

As part of the attribute rename (which used to be called property) we
should have renamed the annotation scope as well to attribute.

In addition, we have a scope type of "entity" but the yarn meta-model
type is really "element".

We should also check if "not applicable" scope is in use, and if not
delete it.

*** Add a new annotation type of "pair"                               :story:

It would be nice to be able to declare a annotation type with a value
type of "pair" or "key value pair" and have the annotations
automatically perform the splitting. The separator should not be
equals, since we already use that for annotations kvps, but it could
be comma, pipe, etc. The API would be augmented to return a
=std::pair= with key and value.

One slight snag: the value could be of any type:

- boolean
- string
- enumeration (when we support these)
- even text collection

We can start by just supporting strings, but probably worthwhile
having a think on how to specify the type.

*** Create a base options class across all tools                      :story:

At present we are copying and pasting a bit of code related to general
options across all the command line tools (knitter, darter, stitcher,
tailor). We could create a base class that has the common options and
then have a factory that populates the boost program options
associated with that class.

Ideally we should also have a log initialisation class that uses those
common options.

*** Implement the database model using Northwind                      :story:

Now we are using Dogen in anger with ODB, we need to make sure the
database model is actually exercising all of this functionality. One
easy way of achieving this is to use Microsoft's Northwind Database as
the base for the model.

- [[https://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/][Northwind Database]]

We should implement it using Oracle and use this to test the changes
to ODB's oracle support.

Tasks:

- add comment for ODB targets
- add flag to mark a type as a value
- case of the identifiers is a problem: sometimes we get them
  uppercase (when we do them without quotes in sql plus) sometimes we
  get them lowercase (from odb). use =--sql-name-case= upper/lower as
  a flag.
- schema initialisation from statics is not working; this is as
  explained in [[http://www.codesynthesis.com/pipermail/odb-users/2013-May/001286.html][this email]]. We can force it by doing a query on that
  entity, but that then causes an exception.
- =head -n 200 northwind_ascii.sql | grep ^INSERT | cut -b 1-150 | uniq=

*** Introduce dogen projects                                          :story:

At present we are manually configuring each dogen target, adding each
separately to the build system. Perhaps a better approach is to have a
dogen project file where one can configure all of the targets in one
go. We don’t necessarily have to call dogen directly – perhaps another
command line tool is responsible for invoking dogen? The problem here
is that we’d end up with all dogen models in memory.

At any rate, the project file would contain all models for a given
product. We could possibly run with “all” or “specific” whereby the
user would supply one or more projects to code generate. For all
properties that are common, we’d defined them only once somehow
(common regexes, log level, etc).

*** Add support for "one off" profiles                                :story:

At present one can define top-level profiles. These are useful, but in
practice we ended up still defining a lot of things in each model. We
need a way to associate a profile with a model by supplying it on the
command line. That way users can create profiles and store them next
to the model rather than having to create a data directory, etc etc.

*** Add option to capitalise column and table names                   :story:

One very useful thing is to allow users to define types in camel case
or underscore separated but then have the ODB names generated all in
caps (schema name, table name, column name). The database we are
currently working with is all in caps and we are forced to manually
enter pragmas for every single type because of this. Instead, we
should have some meta-data:

: odb.use_capitals=true

This would automatically generate the pragmas.

One slight downside is that if a user then tries to manually override
the pragmas, we will have duplicates, in effect:

: #DOGEN odb_pragma=schema("northwind")
: #DOGEN odb_pragma=schema("NORTHWIND")

*** Add prefetch support to ODB                                       :story:

As per Boris email:

#+begin_quote
Hm, I am not sure the bulk approach (with a compiler-time pragma) is
right in this case. There we don't really have a choice since we need
to know the "batch buffer" size.

But here it is all runtime. Plus, you may want to have different
prefetch for different queries of the same object. In fact, you
can already customize it for queries (but not for object loads)
by using prepared queries (Section 4.5 in the manual):

1. Create prepared query.

2. Get its statement (statement()).

3. Cast it to odb::oracle::select_statement.

4. Call handle() on the result to get OCIStmt*.

5. Set custom OCI_ATTR_PREFETCH_ROWS.

6. Execute the query.

The problems with this approach are: (1) it is tedious and (2) it
doesn't work for non-query SELECT's (e.g., database::load()). So
perhaps the way to do it is:

1. Provide prefetch() functions on oracle::database() and
   oracle::connection() that can be used to modify database-wide
   and connection-wide prefetch values. Also set it to some
   reasonable default (say 512?)

2. Provide oracle::select_statement::prefetch() to make the
   prepared query approach less tedious.

*** Replace the database model with the northwind model               :story:

As part of the [[https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/zango][zango]] project we are creating a model that exercises
Dogen and ODB. It is largely based on the database model, minus the
basic types we had added a while ago. We should just drop the database
model and adopt the northwind model from zango.

*** Add ODB to the build machine                                      :story:

At present we are only compiling and running the ODB tests
locally. Now that ODB is becoming a core dependency, we need to make
sure we are running these tests on the build machines - Windows and
Linux at least.

*** Rename ODB parameters                                             :story:

At present we use the following form:

: #DOGEN ODB_PRAGMA=no_id

We need to use the new naming style =cpp.odb.pragma=. We also need to
rename the opaque_parameters to reflect ODB specific data.

*** Map upsilon primitives to intrinsics                              :story:

Upsilon allows users to create "strong typedefs" around primitve
types. We need to unpack these into their intrinsic counterparts and
them map the intrinsics to native types.

Slight mistake: we mapped the primitive types themselves but in
reality what needs to be mapped are the fields making references to
the primitive types. We should just filter out all primitives.

Additional wrinkle: what the end users want is to unpack "real
primitives" into intrinsics, but "other" primitives should be mapped
to objects. This can be achieved by hard-coding =Plaform= primitives
into the mapping layer. However, some non-platform primitives may also
be candidates too. We need to create a list of these to see how
widespread the problem is.

Another alternative is to apply hard-coded regexes:

- if the name matches any of the intrinsic names

Finally, the last option may be to have yet another mapping data file
format that lists the primitives to unbox.

*** Immutable types cannot be owned by mutable types                  :story:

When we try to create a mutable class that has a property of an
immutable type, the code fails to compile due to the swap
method. This is because immutable types do not provide swap.
