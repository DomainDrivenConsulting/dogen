We need to implement a stitch template for the class
implementation formatter in types, plug it in and start working
through the diffs.

Problems to solve:

- legacy incorrectly includes io of parents in types. Remove it.

Solved problems:

- includes will fail on stream manipulators. This is because we need
  to check if we require them when generating dependencies, but we
  have to do so manually since the class info doesn't exist yet. We
  need to hack this for now - once we have "field gathering" support
  this will be easier.
- we need family back to determine what helpers to generate from the
  properties. Hack is fine for now.
- no includes and no space after includes.
- float property with too mnay close brackets:

: -      float_property_(float_property) { }
: +      float_property_(float_property)) { }

- no swap, equality, assignment, getters and setters
