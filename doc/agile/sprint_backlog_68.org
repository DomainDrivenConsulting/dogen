*** STARTED Sprint and product backlog grooming                       :story:
    CLOCK: [2015-06-08 Mon 18:01]--[2015-06-08 Mon 18:09] =>  0:08

Updates to sprint and product backlog.

*** Updates to the manual and readme files                            :story:

Use downtime to update the manual and / or readme file.

*** Implement class implementation formatter using stitch             :story:

We need to implement a stitch template for the class
implementation formatter in types, plug it in and start working
through the diffs.

Problems:

- includes will fail on stream manipulators. This is because we need
  to check if we require them when generating dependencies, but we
  have to do so manually since the class info doesn't exist yet. We
  need to hack this for now - once we have "field gathering" support
  this will be easier.
- we need family back to determine what helpers to generate from the
  properties.
- no includes and no space after includes
- float property with too mnay close brackets:

: -      float_property_(float_property) { }
: +      float_property_(float_property)) { }

- no swap, equality, assignment, getters and setters
