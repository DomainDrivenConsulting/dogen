*** Variability feature clean-up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   2d
   :BLOCKER:  start
   :allocate: s18
   :END:

- create templates to generate types and associated annotation type
  infrastructure (e.g. fields, etc), as well as methods to read these
  from annotations.
- replace existing code with generated code.

*** Fabric clean-up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   2d
   :BLOCKER:  previous-sibling
   :allocate: s18
   :END:

- move all C++ fabric types into coding.
- move all C# fabric types into coding.

*** Generation meta-model clean-up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   4d
   :BLOCKER:  previous-sibling
   :allocate: s19
   :END:

- remove all types that are in coding but are related to generation
  space to generation, making sure they are properly copied across.

*** Formattables clean-up
