** Software Development

*** Extraction clean-up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   3d
   :BLOCKER:  start
   :allocate: s14
   :END:

- move modelines, licences, etc into meta-model.
- create transforms to assemble decoration in generation.
- move formatters into generation.
- move utility formatters into generation.
- Sprint 14.

*** Annotations profile clean-up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   3d
   :BLOCKER:  previous-sibling
   :allocate: s15
   :END:

- create types to represent profiles and profile inheritance in
  coding.
- create transforms that use the coding types to instantiate
  annotations infrastructure.
- update context factories to read annotation information from the
  model itself.

*** Annotations types clean-up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   2d
   :BLOCKER:  previous-sibling
   :allocate: s16
   :END:

- create templates to generate types and associated annotation type
  infrastructure (e.g. fields, etc), as well as methods to read these
  from annotations.
- replace existing code with generated code.
- add infrastructure to register these types.

*** Fabric clean-up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   3d
   :BLOCKER:  previous-sibling
   :allocate: s17
   :END:

- move all C++ fabric types into coding.
- move all C# fabric types into coding.

*** Generation meta-model clean-up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   3d
   :BLOCKER:  previous-sibling
   :allocate: s17
   :END:

- remove all types that are in coding but are related to generation
  space to generation, making sure they are properly copied across.

*** Formattables clean-up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   3d
   :BLOCKER:  previous-sibling
   :allocate: s17
   :END:

- move formattables concepts into generation, generalising them. This
  includes dependencies, etc.

*** Generation extraction model
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   2d
   :BLOCKER:  previous-sibling
   :allocate: s18
   :END:

- when C++ and C# models only have formatters, merge them into one
  model.

*** Makefiles clean up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   2d
   :BLOCKER:  previous-sibling
   :allocate: s18
   :END:

- update all CMake templates with latest layout from hand-crafted
  files.

*** Product generation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   3d
   :BLOCKER:  previous-sibling
   :allocate: s19
   :END:

- add proudct and product family level entities to coding.

** Milestones
*** Project start
    :PROPERTIES:
    :task_id:  start
    :start:    2019-04-25
    :END:

* Sprints                                              :taskjuggler_resource:
