*** IMPLEMENTATION Release notes and backlog grooming                  :task:
    CLOCK: [2013-12-03 Tue 08:01]--[2013-12-03 Tue 08:06] =>  0:05

*** Update manual                                                     :story:

Use compilation downtime to update the manual.

*** IMPLEMENTATION Add more tests to =concept_indexer=                :story:

**** IMPLEMENTATION Finish adding unit tests for modeled concepts      :task:
     CLOCK: [2013-12-03 Tue 08:06]--[2013-12-03 Tue 08:48] =>  0:42

**** Add unit tests for the indexing of properties                     :task:
**** Add unit tests for the indexing of relationships                  :task:
*** Plug =concept_indexer= into workflow                              :story:
*** Populate new concept properties in dia to sml transformer         :story:

- populate =is_parent= and =is_child=

*** Finish implementation of =inheritance_indexer= and add tests      :story:
**** Update transformer to populate basic relationships                :task:
**** Implement indexing of associations, keys and visitor              :task:
**** Plug into workflow                                                :task:
*** Replace existing structures with indexing ones                    :story:

Make use of the indexing information in legacy C++ formatters as a way
to validate that it is correct.

**** Create a helper class to handle relationships                     :task:

- =find_relationship=: gets a specific relationship container, returns
  empty if it does not exist.
- =find_relationship_strict=: gets a specific relationship container,
  throws if it does not exist.

**** Replace original parent/parent functionality with relationships   :task:

- delete leaves, original parent, parent attributes and use
  relationships instead.

**** Replace the concepts expansion code with relationships            :task:
**** Replace C++ property handling code with relationships             :task:
**** Replace association, keys and visitor with relationships          :task:

*** Add include file support to main type formatter                   :story:

Inclusion support needs to be moved to the formatters. SML provides
all the required information at the model level in terms of type
dependencies, but only the formatter itself knows what includes it
needs because these are related to the implementation. Even
determining which facets of a type one should include is formatter
dependent. We need to distribute the logic of the includer into each
formatter.
