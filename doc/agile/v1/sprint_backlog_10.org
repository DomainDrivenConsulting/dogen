Title: Dogen v1.0.09, "Kubata"

#+begin_src markdown
![Kubata](http://www.africavernaculararchitecture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Angola-Flickr-Rob-and-Sophie55061521f2fff.jpg) _Traditional Angolan village house. [(C) Rob and Sophie](http://www.africavernaculararchitecture.com/angola/)_.

# Overview

As described on [the previous sprint](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.08), the key objective at present is to get all the infrastructure up-to-date after a hiatus of a year or so of development. This is a requirement so that we can move to C++ 17 and start to make use of all the nice new libraries available. As such, this sprint was entirely taken with infrastructure clean up. Whilst these changes are not user visible, they still provide important benefits to project development so we'll briefly summarise them here.

## MASD Project Transition

We have started to sync up the work on the PhD with the work on Dogen. This sprint, the main focus was on creating an organisation solely for _Model Assisted Software Development_ (more details on that in the future), and moving all of the infrastructure to match - [Bintray](https://bintray.com/masd-project/main/dogen), [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/MASD-Project/dogen/builds), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/MASD-Project/Lobby) and the like.

## Move to vcpkg

Historically, we've always had a problem in keeping dogen's dependencies up-to-date across the three supported platforms. The problem stems from a lack of a cross-platform package manager in C++. Whilst we tried [Conan](https://conan.io/) in the past, we never managed to get it working properly for our setup. With this sprint we started the move towards using [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Whilst it still has some deficiencies, it addresses our use case particularly well and will allow us to pick up new dependencies fairly easily going forward. This is crucial as we expand the number of facets available, which hopefully will happen over the next couple of months. In this sprint we have completed the transition to vcpkg for Linux and Windows; the next sprint will be OSX's turn. With the introduction of vcpkg we took the opportunity to upgrade to [boost 1.68](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_68_0.html) on Linux and Windows.

## Add CDash support

Since we moved away from our own infrastructure we lost the ability to know which tests are passing and how long test execution is taking. With this sprint we resurrected CDash/CTest support, with a new dashboard, available [here](https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=MASD+Project+-+Dogen). There are still a few tweaks required - a lot of tests are still failing due to setup issues - but its clearly a win as we can now see a clearer picture across the testing landscape.

## Move reference models out of Dogen's repository

For a long time we've been struggling to build Dogen within the hour given to us by Travis. An easy win was to move the reference models ([C++](https://github.com/MASD-Project/cpp_ref_impl) and [C#](https://github.com/MASD-Project/csharp_ref_impl)) away from the main repository. This is also a very logical thing to do as we want these to be examples of stand-alone Dogen products, so that we can point them out to users as an example of how to use the product. Work still remains to be done on the reference implementations (CTest/CDash integration, clean up tests) but the bulk has been done this sprint.

For more details of the work carried out this sprint, see [the sprint log](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_09.org).

# User visible changes

Two tiny featurelets were added this sprint:

- **Development Binaries**: We now generate binaries for development releases. These are overwritten with every commit on BinTray.
- **Improvements on ```--version```**: The command now outputs build information to link it back to the build agent and build number. Note that these details are used only for information purposes. We will add GPG signatures in the future to validate the binaries.

# Next Sprint

Infrastructural work will hopefully conclude on the next sprint, but the next big task is getting all the tests to run and pass.

# Binaries

You can download binaries from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/masd-project/main/dogen) for OSX, Linux and Windows (all 64-bit):

- [dogen_1.0.09_amd64-applications.deb](https://dl.bintray.com/masd-project/main/1.0.09/:dogen_1.0.09_amd64-applications.deb)
- [dogen-1.0.09-Darwin-x86_64.dmg](https://dl.bintray.com/masd-project/main/1.0.09/:dogen-1.0.09-Darwin-x86_64.dmg)
- [dogen-1.0.09-Windows-AMD64.msi](https://dl.bintray.com/masd-project/main/:dogen-1.0.09-Windows-AMD64.msi)

For all other architectures and/or operative systems, you will need to build Dogen from source. Source downloads are available below.

Try to see how hard it is to integrate kcov with the current build.

Notes:

- annoyingly, kcov has some binary dependencies rather than being a
  stand alone binary:

: apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libdw-dev libiberty-dev

  as we could not figure out how to install just the SO's in travis,
  we ended up installing the dev packages. These are a lot more than
  what is actually required, but it'll do for now.
- we seem to upload to coveralls, but nothing shows up on the
  site. Try to manually generate coverage first.

At present we are not building and deploying for tags on Windows. This
is a major pain because it means we must remember to always push the
tag separately. We need to setup appveyor correctly.

It appears filtering on branches (master only) disables building on
tags. We've now removed this.

Following on from our investigation, we need to add vcpkg to the
travis osx builds (clang). While we're there, update all the tools to
latest in preparation to switching to C++ 17.

Notes:

- it seems its not possible to move to XCode 10 without upgrading the
  OS. This includes the Command Line tools only package as well.
- an alternative is to install the LLVM + clang package supplied by
  the LLVM project. The disadvantage is that we probably also need to
  use this in travis because using two different versions of clang is
  probably not the best idea. We could try and see what happens first,
  but ultimately we'll end up having to install it on travis. The
  binary is 300 MB, which is not ideal but should be ok.
- vcpkg misbehaves a bit when used from clang7. [[https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues/4476][Reported]] to
  mothership.

For some reason the badge is gray with the words error. This makes it
less obvious that the build is borked. Fix it so its red.

Seems this is because we are using shields.io rather than the travis
badge.

Actually maybe this is due to the fact that there is currently an
ongoing build. Lets ignore it for now.

At present we have a number of tests that are commented out but appear
as failing under cdash. This is very confusing. We need to mark them
with the ignore macro. We should not waste time fixing the tests as
they need to be re-written using the diff framework.

We seem to have 50 warnings on both OSX and linux builds, which is a
bit of a coincidence. CTest is probably clipping the warnings.

It is the default. Configured by
=CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_WARNINGS=.

Zero is not a good number - it removed all the warnings. Set it to a

Setting visibility to hidden does not seem to make any difference.

There are quite a few dependencies for this to happen:

- on windows we need to somehow include =/std:c++latest=
- we need to move to latest boost as it seems Boost 1.62 breaks on c++
  17. We should wait until Beast is included in Boost before we do
  this.
- we need to install latest CMake, which is not available on nuget; so
  we need to fetch the zip/msi from https://cmake.org/files/v3.10/ and
  unpack it. Only latest supports VS 2017. Then set the CMake
  generator:

:    $generator="Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64";

- set the appveyor image:

: image:
:  - Visual Studio 2017

- set the CMake version:

:     set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)

We have now fulfilled all of these requirements, so try to move to
C++17.

Package went from 5 MB to 80 MB over the last 3 days. The cause for

It seems we can no longer build off of a github commit on

The problem is we removed =WITH_MINIMAL_PACKAGING= with the move to

returned to normal size.

*** COMPLETED Add support for code coverage                           :story:
    CLOSED: [2018-10-17 Wed 09:43]

*Rationale*: implemented using kcov.

We started the work on code coverage but never finished it. At present
it seems we don't even have a story detailing the current state of
coverage in the backlog. From memory the problem was that the upload
was too large and the coverage was including lots of files that should
be ignored. We never got the upload to work. In the mean time, it
seems that kcov is a better approach instead of using lcov, gcov, etc.

Links:

- https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov

*Previous understanding*

Finish setting up coveralls

Remaining issues:

- we are generating far too much output. We need to keep it quieter or
  we will break travis.
- we are not filtering out non-project files from initial
  processing. There must be a gcov option to ignore files.

Jot down ideas on the separation between the API and the
implementation in dogen products.

Notes:

- we now have the notion of "distribution channels": UI/UX (wt, qt, gtk
  mobile, etc), DX (swagger, boost asio, library itself).
- the product API should not have any dependencies in terms of storage
  mechanisms; it should have some kind of "model source" interface
  that can then be implemented in terms of the filesystem, GH repo,
  postgres database etc.
- even though it does not make a lot of sense to have a model source
  as part of the remoting API, for consistency reasons we should still
  support it. That is, a code generation end point will merely call
  some internal functions to source the models rather than call
  another endpoint, and users probably don't really need something
  that just reads a model and returns the injector version.
- the distribution channels are a function of the product API.
- according to the [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/][Framework Design Guidelines]], we should design the
  API from scenarios. We should create a specification document that
  can be added to the manual for this.

Even after offloading all of the test models, we are still breaching

unused types and remove them.

*** Create a single binary for all of dogen                           :story:

As per analysis, we need to create a single dogen binary, like so:

: dogen.cli COMMAND COMMAND_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS

Where =COMMAND= is:

- =transform=: functionality that is currently in tailor.
- =generate=: functionality that is currently in knitter.
- =expand=: functionality that is currently in stitcher plus expansion
  of wale templates.
- =make=: functionality in darter: create project, structure etc.

In order to support sub-commands we need to do a lot of hackery with
program options:

- [[https://gist.github.com/randomphrase/10801888][cmdoptions.cpp]]: Demonstration of how to do subcommand option
  processing with boost program_options
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15541498/how-to-implement-subcommands-using-boost-program-options][How to implement subcommands using Boost.Program_options?]]

*Merged Stories*

We started off by creating lots of little executables: knitter,
darter, tailor, stitcher. Each of these has its own project,
command-line options etc. However, now that we are concentrating all
of the domain knowledge in yarn, it seems less useful to have so many
executables that are simply calling yarn transforms. Instead, it may
make more sense to use an approach similar to git and have a
"sub-command":

: dogen knit
: dogen tailor

And so forth. Of course, we could also take this opportunity and clean
up these names to making them more meaningful to end users. Perhaps:

: dogen codegen
: dogen transform

Each of these sub-commands or modes would have their own set of
associated options. We need to figure out how this is done using boost
program options. We also need to spend a bit of time working out the
sub-commands to make sure they make sense across the board.

In terms of names, we can't really call the project "dogen". We should
call it something allusive to the command line, such as cli. However,
the final binary should be called dogen or perhaps, =dogen.cli=. This
fits in with other binaries such as =dogen.web=, =dogen.http=,
=dogen.gui= etc.

*** Add support for inline namespaces                                 :story:

Enable c++17. - windows requires cpp latest. Then fix inner namespaces
(e.g. a::b::c).

We still need to support the old syntax for pre c++-17.

We need to add a new standard to =quilt.cpp= and when its set to
c++-17 we should automatically use inline namespaces.

*** Create some basic naming guidelines                               :story:

As per Framework Design Guidelines, we need some basic guidelines for
naming in Dogen. We don't need to go overboard, we just need something
to get us started and evolve it as we go along.

*** Problems in tailor generation of dogen models                     :story:

Regenerated all models, got the following errors:

- we are adding the extension to the dia filename because of how CMake
  works. We should probably remove the output parameter or at least
  allow defaulting it to a replacement of the extension.
- we are removing the dependencies due to duplicates in JSON keys.
- we are looking for .dia diagrams instead of .json for references.

*Previous Understanding*

We converted all of dogen's models from dia into JSON using tailor and
code-generated them to see if there were any differences.

Issues to address:

- problems with =quilt.cpp= and =yarn.dia= / =yarn.json=: the
  conversion of the model path did not work as expected - we do not
  know of the "."  separator. Fixed it manually and then it all worked
  (minus CMakeLists, see below). We could possibly fix the builder to
  automatically use the "." to separate model paths. Actually with the
  latest changes we now seem to only be looking at the first model
  module, so for =yarn.dia= we only have =yarn=.
- CMakeLists were deleted on all models for some reason, even though
  the annotations profile look correct.
- in quilt we correctly generated the forward declarations for
  registrar error and workflow error without including boost
  exception. Not sure why that is, nor why it is that we are including
  them for forward declarations.
- Missing include of registrar serialisation in
  =all_ser.hpp=. Instability in =registrar_ser.cpp=, but content is
  correct otherwise.
- =database.json= generated invalid JSON.
- references in dia diagrams have the dia extension. This means that
  they do not resolve when converted to JSON.

"Script":

#+begin_src
rm *.json
A="dia knit quilt.cpp wale yarn.json annotations formatters quilt yarn database options stitch yarn.dia"
for a in $A; do /home/marco/Development/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/build/output/gcc/Release/stage/bin/dogen.tailor -t $a.dia -o $a.json; done
for a in $A; do /home/marco/Development/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/build/output/gcc/Release/stage/bin/dogen.knitter -t ${a}.json --cpp-project-dir /home/marco/Development/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/projects --ignore-files-matching-regex .*/CMakeLists.txt --ignore-files-matching-regex .*/test/.* --ignore-files-matching-regex .*/tests/.* --verbose --delete-extra-files; done
#+end_src

In an ideal world, we should probably have a script that we run as
part of =knit_and_stitch= that converts to tailor and then runs
knitter on the models, so that we keep track of tailor breaks outside
of JSON test models.

*** Log file names do not have frontend                               :story:

Add extension to log file name so that we can see both Dia and JSON
logs at the same time. At present, one overwrites the other because we
do not have the frontend (e.g. the extension) on the log file name.

*** Update static strings to string views                             :story:

Now we're on C++17 we can start making use of its new features. One
low hanging fruit is string view. We use static strings quite a lot
for logging etc. We can just replace these with string views.

*** Add basic "diff mode"                                             :story:

We need a very simple way of checking all generated files in memory
against what's in the file system and returning a flag if they are
different. We can then use these flags to determine if tests pass. In
the future we can extend this approach to include a proper diff of the
files, but for now we just need a reliable way to run system tests
again.

Actually the right solution for this is to see the processing as part
of a chain:

- out of the generator come a set of artefacts with operations (write,
  merge, ignore)
- these get joined with a transform that reads the state of the file
  system. It then adds more operations: delete, etc. If there are no
  diffs, it marks those files as skip.
- the final step is a processor which gets that model and executes the
  operations. This can then be replaced by a "reporter" that simply
  states what the operations would be.

Diff mode is using the report to see if there are any diffs.

Merged Stories:

*Validation-only or dry-run mode*

Both stitcher and knitter could do with a "dry-run" mode in which we'd
do everything except for actually outputting.

*For Knitter*

It would be nice if one could just check if a dia diagram is valid for
code generation, e.g. =--validate= or something along those lines.

*For Stitch*

We are interested in performing the parsing. This would be useful for
example for a flymake mode in emacs.

An additional feature of dry-run would be to run, generate the model
and then produce a unified diff, e.g. tell me what you'd change. For
this we'd have to link against a diff library. We need to
automatically exclude non-overwrite files (or have an option to
exclude/include them).

*Dry-run option to just diff with existing generated code*

#+begin_quote
*Story*: As a dogen user, I want to know what has changed with the
next code generation so that I can evaluate if the changes are as
expected or not.
#+end_quote

It would be useful to have an option that would do everything except
writing the files to disk; instead, it would diff them with the
existing files and report if there are any differences. This would be
useful to make sure the source code matches the latest version of the
diagram.

We could use something like the [[https://code.google.com/p/dtl-cpp/wiki/Tutorial][DTL library]].

*** Rename debian package                                             :story:

At present our package is called =dogen-applcations=. Since there will
only be one dogen application/package, this is a confusion name. We
should rename it. Names:

- masd-dogen

*** Finish adding support for clang-cl builds                         :story:

We have added preliminary support for building with clang-cl on
windows, but the build is not green. Most of the errors seem to be on
boost.

*** Tidy-up dogen windows package                                     :story:

There are a few inconsistencies with the package:

- dogen components have a strange structure:
  "Dogen/runtime/dogen".
- we should probably have a top-level umbrella for MASD, under which
  dogen installs.
- package name is windows amd64. We should use the vcpkg triplets for
  simplicity (e.g. x64-windows).

*** Mapping of third-party dependencies                               :story:

System models should follow the physical structure of
dependencies. That is, we should not have a "boost" system model, but
instead a boost-test etc. Each of these can then have mappings
(e.g. vcpkg name, build2 name, etc). Users must declare these
references just like they do with user models. Dogen can then create
code for:

- cmake targets, properly linking against libraries;
- vcpkg install, at product level, by de-duplicating component
  dependencies;
- possibly distro dependencies.

We should only have a mandatory dependency, which is the STL. In
addition, we need different models for each version (e.g. c++ 03,
etc). This makes it easier to include the right types.

Note that each model must have an associated version. The version
should be part of the file name. However, maybe we need to distinguish
between TS version (11, 17, etc) from library version.

*** Rename input models directory to models                           :story:

We need to move the dogen project to the new directory layout whereby
all models are kept in the =models= directory.

*** dogen as a github integration                                     :story:

Perhaps there are some useful services dogen could provide to users in
terms of dogen integration. If, with every commit, we could regenerate
the model and read the current state in github, we could then provide
a status report:

- the model does not build; red emblem. Some changes were made to the
  model (or to dogen) that make the model invalid. User should take
  action.
- the model builds but generates files that are different from what's
  checked in on github. yellow emblem. Provide a report with the
  diffs. This can either be because the code generator has changed or
  the user changed the model.
- the model builds and generates exactly the same code; green emblem.

With this approach we have two advantages:

- we do not need to add projects as part of the dogen tests; the
  service takes its place. We can still add a few as the core tests,
  but we don't need to expand it much beyond reference implementation
  and dogen itself.
- we exercise dogen itself as well as the rest endpoint generation
  code in a way that is actually useful to end users; it would be nice
  to know immediately when something breaks.

Notes:

- we'll need some kind of way of dealing with tokens and secrets in
  order to support private GH projects.

*** Add reporting support to dogen model testing                      :story:

Dogen should have a mode which generates a report for a run rather
than code generate. The report could look like so:

:              /project_a
:                  /summary for this commit
:                  /diffs
:                  /errors
:                  /benchmark data
:                  /probing data
:                  /log

If the report was largely in HTML we could link it to the dogen docs
and save it into git. This would make troubleshooting much easier. If
the report contains the probing data it would be easier to figure out
what went wrong. We should also keep track of the model that was
generated (e.g. its location and git commit) so we can download it and
reproduce it locally.

*** Rework the tests using diff mode                                  :story:

Once we have diff mode, we need to find some kind of workflow for
tests:

- each product is composed of a git URL and a list of models.
- we git clone all repos as part of the build process.
- directories and model locations are hard-coded in each test.
- test runs against the model and hard-coded location, produces the
  diff. Test asserts of the diff being non-zero.

*** Fix the northwind model                                           :story:

There are numerous problems with this model:

- at present we have oracle support on ODB. Oracle libs are not
  distributed with debian. If we do not find oracle we do not compile
  northwind. This is not ideal. We should remove oracle support from
  northwind, and install odb support in the build machine (hopefully
  available as debs).
- the tests are commented out and require a clean up.
- the tests require a database to be up.

Notes:

- it is possible to setup [[https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/#postgresql][postgres on travis]]

*** Simplify split configuration configuration                        :story:

At present we have two separate command line parameters to configure
the main output directory and the directory for header files. The
second parameter is used for split configurations. The problem is that
we now need to treat split configuration projects specially because of
this. It makes more sense to force the header directory to be relative
to the output path and make it a meta-data parameter.

*** Make "ignore regexes" a model property                            :story:

At present we have a command line option:
=--ignore-files-matching-regex=. It is used to ignore files in a
project. However, the problem is, because it is a command line option,
it must be supplied with each invocation of Dogen. This means that if
we want to run dogen from outside the build system, we need to know
what options were set in the build scripts or else we will have
different results. This is a problem for testing. We should make it a
meta-data option, which is supplied with each model and even more
interesting, can be used with profiling. This means we can create
profiles for specific purposes (ODB, lisp, etc) and then reuse them in
different projects.

We should do the same thing for =--delete-extra-files=.

*** Update all stereotypes to masd                                    :story:

We need to start distinguishing MASD from dogen. The profile for UML
is part of MASD rather than dogen, so we should update all stereotypes
to match. We need to make a decision regarding the "dia extensions" -
its not clear if its MASD or dogen.

*** Incorrect generation when changing external modules               :story:

When fixing the C# projects, we updated the external modules, from
=dogen::test_models= to =CSharpRefImpl=. Regenerating the model
resulted in updated project files but the rest of the code did not
change. It worked by using =-f=. It should have worked without forcing
the write.

*** Code coverage does not work for C#                                :story:

It seems that using NUnit and OpenCov does not work. The main reason
appears to be the use of shadow copying, which is no longer optional
on NUnit 3.

*** Improve comments on reference implementation                      :story:

At present it is very difficult to understand what each model and/or
each type does in the reference implementations. We need to add some
comments to make it more obvious.

*** Code generate C# models using msbuild                             :story:

At present we did a quick hack to code generate in C#: a simple bash
script that runs dogen. However, this is not how we expect the end
user to consume it; there should be a msbuild target that:

- detects the code generator;
- contains the configuration (e.g. options, location of models);'
- runs the code generator - possibly every time models change;
- has a tailor target to generate JSON.

*** Add project documentation                                         :story:

We should be able to create a simple set of docs following on from the
[[https://ned14.github.io/outcome/][outcome project]]. They seem to be using Hugo.

Links:

- https://github.com/foonathan/standardese

*** Create the =generation= model                                     :story:

Create a new model called =generation= and move all code-generation
related class to it.

We need to create classes for element properties and make model have a
collection that is a pair of element and element properties. We need a
good name for this pair:

- extended element
- augmented element
- decorated element: though not using the decorator pattern; also, we
  already have decoration properties so this is confusing.

Alternatively we could just call it =element= and make it contain a
modeling element.

Approach:

- create a new generation model, copying across all of the meta-model
  and transform classes from yarn. Get the model to transform from
  endomodel to generation model.
- augment formattables with the new element properties. Supply this
  data via the context or assistant.

Problems:

- all of the transforms assume access to the modeling element means
  access to the generation properties. However, with the introduction
  of the generation element we now have a disconnect. For example, we
  sometimes sort and bucket the elements, and then modify them; this
  no longer works with generation elements because these are not
  pointers. It would be easier to make the generation properties a
  part of the element. This is an ongoing discussion we've had since
  the days of formattables. However, in formattables we did write all
  of the transforms to take into account the formattable contained
  both the element and the formattable properties, whereas now we need
  to update all transforms to fit this approach. This is a lot more
  work. The quick hack is to slot in the properties directly into the
  element as some kind of "opaque properties". We could create a base
  class =opaque_properties= and then have a container of these in
  element. However, to make it properly extensible, the only way is to
  make it a unordered set of pointers.
- actually the right solution for this is to use multiple
  inheritance. For each modeling element we need to create a
  corresponding generation version of it, which is the combination of
  the modeling element and a generation element base class. Them the
  generation model is made up of pointers to generation elements and
  it dispatches into generation elements descendants in the
  formatter. The key point is to preserve the distinction between
  modeling (single element) vs generation (projection across facet
  space).

*** Create a =ci= folder in build                                     :story:

We should use the same approach as nupic for organising the scripts: a
top-level =ci= folder with folders per CI system. We should also
follow their naming convention for the build scripts which seem to
follow the CI events.

Links:

- https://github.com/numenta/nupic.core/tree/master/ci

*** Adding reference to itself results in resolution errors           :story:

Whilst trying to fix the JSON models we inadvertently added a
self-reference in =dogen.generation.json=:

:    "yarn.reference": "dogen.generation.json",

This resulted in some puzzling errors:

: 2018-10-18 19:15:00.861210 [ERROR] [yarn.transforms.enablement_transform] Duplicate element archetype: quilt.cpp.serialization.registrar_implementation <dogen><generation><registrar>

Ideally we should either warn and ignore or fail to process models
with self-references.
