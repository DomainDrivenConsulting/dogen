# Introduction

Happy new year! The first release of the year is a bit of a bumper one: we finally managed to add support for [org-mode](https://orgmode.org), and transitioned _all_ of Dogen to it. It was a mammoth effort, consuming the entirety of the holiday season, but it is somewhat refreshing to finally add a significant user facing feature. Alas, this is also a bit of a bitter-sweet release because we now have more or less run out of coding time, and need to redirect our focus towards writing the PhD thesis. On the plus side, the architecture is now up-to-date with the conceptual model - mostly - and the bits that aren't, are fairly straightforward (famous last words). And this is nothing new; Dogen development has always oscillated between theory and practice. If you recall, a couple of years ago we had to take a nine-month coding break to learn about the theoretical underpinnings of [MDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) and then resumed coding on [Sprint 8](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.08) for what turned out to be a 22-sprint marathon (pun intended) to apply all that was learned. Sprint 30 brings this long cycle to a close - though this time we are hoping our travels through the literature will be a lot shorter. But lets not get too lost talking about the future, and instead focus on the release at hand.

# User visible changes

## Org-mode support

A target that we've been chasing for the longest time is the ability to write models using [org-mode](https://orgmode.org). We use org-mode (and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs)) for pretty much everything, such time keeping and task management (_i.e._, its how we manage our  [sprint backlogs](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_30.org) and [product backlog](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org)) and we'll soon be using it to write [academic papers](https://jonathanabennett.github.io/blog/2019/05/29/writing-academic-papers-with-org-mode/) too. It is just an amazing tool with a great tooling ecosystem, so it seemed only natural to try and see if we could make use of it for modeling too. Now, even though we are very comfortable with org-mode, this is not a decision to be taken lightly because we've been using [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia) since the beginning of Dogen Development some eight or more years ago.

_Figure 1: Dia diagram for a Dogen model with the introduction of colouring, Dogen [v1.0.06](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.06)_

However, as much as we profoundly love Dia, we've long had some concerns with relying on it _too much_ due to its [sparse maintenance](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dia). In particular, Dia relies on an old version of GTK, meaning it could get pulled from distributions at any time; we've already had a similar experience with [Gnome Referencer](https://tracker.debian.org/news/937606/removed-122-2-from-unstable/), which wasn't at all pleasant. In addition, there are a number of "papercuts" that are mildly annoying, if livable, and which will probably not be addressed; we had a list of [such issues](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_28.org#dia-limitations-that-impact-dogen-usage), in the hopes of eventually fixing these problems upstream. The direction of the maintenance is also not aligned with our needs; for example, we recently saw the removal of python support in Dia - at least in the version which ships with Debian - which we used to use a fair bit. So, as you can see, we had a number of ongoing worries that motivated our decision. However,  I don't want to sound too negative here - and please don't take any of this as a criticism to Dia or its developers. Dia is an absolutely brilliant tool, and we have used it for many, many years; It is great at what it does, and we'll continue to use it for free modeling. Nonetheless, it has become increasingly clear that the directions of Dia and Dogen have started to diverge over the last few years, and we could not ignore that. I'd like to take this opportunity to give a huge thanks to all of those involved in Dia (past and present); they have certainly created an amazing tool that stood the test of time. Also, although we are moving away from Dia use in mainline Dogen, we will continue to support the Dia codec and we have tests to ensure that the current set of features [will continue to work](https://github.com/MASD-Project/frozen).

That's that for the rationale for moving away from Dia. But why org-mode? We came up with a nice laundry list of reasons:

- org-mode documents are trees, with arbitrary nesting, which makes it a good candidate to represent the nesting of namespaces and classes.
- within the org-mode document we have full access to Emacs features. For example, we have spell checkers, regular copy-and-pasting, etc. This greatly simplifies the management of models.
- org-mode documents are regular text files, and thus easy to lifecycle in a similar fashion to code; for example, one can version control and diff these documents very easily. Now, we did have Dia's files in uncompressed XML, bringing some of these advantages, but due to the verbosity of XML it was very hard to see the wood for the trees. Every time we touched a model element, lots of lines would change, making it difficult to understand the nature of the change.
- org-mode is fairly universal, with support in [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/vscode-org-mode/vscode-org-mode) and even [Vim](https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode). See also [Get started with Org mode without Emacs](https://opensource.com/article/19/1/productivity-tool-org-mode). None of these implementations are as good as Emacs, of course - not that we are biased, or anything - but they are sufficient to at least allow for basic model editing. And installing a simple plugin in your editor of choice is much easier than having to learn a whole new tool.
- Dogen aims to take the approach of "Literate Modeling" described in papers such as [Literate Modelling - Capturing Business Knowledge
with the UML](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/933/1/10.0_Literate_Modelling.pdf). It was clear from the start that a tool like Dia would not be able to capture the wealth of information we intended to add to the models. Org-mode on the other hand is the ideal format to bring disparate types of information together (see [Replacing Jupyter with Orgmode](https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode) for an example of the sort of thing we have in mind).

We've had already done a fair bit of experimenting with generating org-mode files from the existing Dia models; it was mostly an exercise in feasibility to see if we could encode all of the required information in a comprehensible manner within the org-mode document. So this sprint we focused on adding end-to-end support for org-mode. This entailed reading org-mode documents, and using them to generate the exact same code as we had from Dia. Unfortunately, though [C++ support for org-mode exists](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tools/index.html), we could not find any suitable library for integration in Dogen. So we decided to write a simple parser for org-mode documents. This isn't a "generic parser" by any means, so if you throw invalid documents at it expect it to blow up unceremonially. In addition, this is clearly a first pass. As always, we need to have a great deal of experience editing models to see what works and what doesn't, and its likely we'll end up changing the markup in the future. However, the main point we wanted to prove is that it is indeed possible to represent all of the information in Dia in a nice manner in org-mode, and
