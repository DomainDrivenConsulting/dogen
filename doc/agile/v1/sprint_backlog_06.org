Title: Dogen v1.0.05, "Tribunal"

#+begin_src markdown

Overview
=======
The bulk of this sprint was focused on three refactoring tasks:

- **Renaming Concepts to Object Templates**: This is a long-standing clean-up that needed doing. One of the key principles in Yarn is to avoid binding to language specific terms when those terms don't cleanly map across to several programming languages. Since inception, "Concepts" has been a flagrant violation, as it alludes to a C++ feature which it isn't even a proper implementation of, nor does it map to generics. With the work on profiles looming, this clean-up became ever more pressing. Granted, "object templates"  is rather more verbose - but we decided to make the change in the interest of cleaning up Yarn vocabulary. It is, at least, a more accurate reflection of this meta-model element's responsibilities.
- **Probing support**: Historically, Dogen has always had good logging, allowing us to troubleshoot most issues quickly. However, with Yarn's transition towards a transformation-based architecture, it has become increasingly difficult to figure out what each transformation is doing. The linear nature of the log does not help, given that one is trying to visualise a graph. Thus, troubleshooting of issues has slowed down noticeably, so something had to be done. Probing is the proposed solution for this problem, and it has already made  troubleshooting orders of magnitude faster. This feature is described in depth below.
- **Work on moving kernel specific transforms**: we continued our long road on moving all of the "kernel-specific" transforms which aren't actually kernel-specific into Yarn. Enablement is almost done, but it remains elusive.

In addition to this, there were other minor (but still significant) strands of work:

- we continued work on the theme "everything is a transform", adding more transform chains and cleaning up more terminology as we went along. This work is now more or less complete, with the core of Yarn providing a set of primitives that are in keeping with the literature on code generation - in particular [Model-Driven Software Engineering in Practice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Model-Driven-Software-Engineering-Practice-Synthesis/dp/1608458822). This has greatly simplified Yarn's conceptual model and vocabulary since we can now rely on "standard" terms.
- in a similar vein, we continued to merge more functionality into Yarn, deprecating the Knit model and moving its contents as transforms into Yarn.

User visible changes
================
The most important user visible changes introduced with this sprint are related to stereotypes:

- all meta-model types must now be prefixed: where you had ```object``` you must now put ```yarn::object```. This change was done in preparation for both the generalisation of profiles, and for adding the ability to refer to object templates (n√©e concepts) across models.
- as explained in the previous section, ```concept``` has been renamed to ```object_template```, so where you had ```concept``` you must now put ```yarn::object_template```.

In addition, there was also a ORM related change that brings it in line with all other tagged values: the low-level ODB parameter was renamed from ```odb_pragma``` to ```quilt.cpp.odb.pragma```. So, in your models, where you had:

```
#DOGEN odb_pragma=no_id
```

You must replace it with:

```
#DOGEN quilt.cpp.odb.pragma=no_id
```

The final user visible change is the most significant in terms of time spent: transform probing. As it happens, it is not really aimed at end-users, but its worth describing the feature as it may still prove to be useful.

A new set of command line options have been added to ```dogen.knitter```:

```
  --probe-stats                         Generate stats about executed
                                        transforms.
  --probe-stats-disable-guids           Disable guids in probe stats, to make
                                        comparisons easier.
  --probe-stats-org-mode                Use org-mode format for stats. Requires
                                        enabling stats.
  --probe-all                           Dump all available probing information
                                        about transforms.
  --probe-directory                     Directory in which to dump probe data.
                                        Only used if transforms probing is
                                        enabled.
  --probe-use-short-names               Use short names for directories and
                                        files. Useful for Windows where long
                                        paths are not supported.
```

We'll start with ```--probe-stats``` and related options, since it is the most likely to be of use to end users. It is now possible to dump statistics about the transform graph, allowing simple benchmarkings. When a user selects this option, a file is generated under the probing directory (configurable via ```--probe-directory```), with the name ```transform_stats.txt```. As an example, here is the ```head``` of the generation of the ```yarn``` model:

```

```

As you can see, each node has the total elapsed time it took the transform to execute. In addition, the root node of the graph contains information about the configuration, so that we can compare like with like. This includes the Dogen version, the type of logging and whether detailed probing was enabled or not. You will also not fail to notice the GUIDs next to each node in the graph. These are correlation IDs, enabling one to find the logging for each of the transforms in the log file:

```
2017-09-18 11:22:11.618837 [DEBUG] [yarn.helpers.transform_prober] Starting: yarn.transforms.endomodel_pre_processing_chain (229a572e-70c1-4934-be79-db7e481de5bc)
```

If instead one just wants to diff two transformation graphs - perhaps looking for performance changes, or changes in the composition of the grap - one can disable the GUIDs via ```--probe-stats-disable-guids```.

```

    dogen.yarn.code_generation_chain (1522 ms) [yarn.dia]
        yarn.transforms.model_generation_chain (1066 ms) []

                    yarn.transforms.exomodel_generation_chain (328 ms) [yarn.dia]

                    yarn.transforms.exomodel_to_endomodel_transform (1 ms) [<dogen><yarn>]
```

For Vi and Emacs users, there is an additional way of interacting with the transform graph: we've added an org-mode compatible dump of the graph via ```--probe-stats-org-mode```. This feature is extremely useful because it allows collapsing and expanding the graph interactively from within the editor:

![org-mode](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/raw/master/doc/blog/images/emacs_org_mode_stats.png)

The second aspect of probing is the ability to dig deep into each transform, in order to understand what it was doing. For this we can use ```--probe-all```. Once enabled, a dump is generated for each transform in the transform graph of its inputs and outputs - where applicable. These are also stored in the probe directory. The directory structure follows the graph:

```
000-archetype_location_repository.json
001-type_repository.json
002-mapping_set_repository.json
003-dogen.yarn.code_generation_chain
transform_stats.txt
```

Each transform chain becomes a directory, and each transform has files with inputs and outputs, in JSON. It is trivial to indent the JSON files and diff input with output to figure out what the transform did - or, more likely, didn't do.

As always, there were complications with Windows. Since this operative system does not support long paths, we found that probing often failed with errors because our transform graph is deeply nested and the transforms have very long names. To allow one to use this feature under Windows, we've added ```--probe-use-short-names```. This makes the files and directories a lot less meaningful, but at least it still works:

```
000.json
001.json
002.json
003
transform_stats.txt
```

It is difficult to overstate the importance of probing in Dogen development. It was already used during this sprint to quickly get to the bottom of issues in enablement, and it was found to greatly simply this task. In the future, when we have rapid JSON support, one can conceive of a feature to read the dumped data into a test to replicate some particular bug very quickly.

Next Sprint

Next sprint we'll resume the work on moving kernel-agnostic transformations from the kernels into yarn.

*** STARTED Sprint and product backlog grooming                       :story:
    CLOCK: [2017-09-18 Mon 00:01]--[2017-09-18 Mon 00:08] =>  0:07

Updates to sprint and product backlog.

*** Move enablement into yarn                                         :story:

It seems that the concepts around enablement are actually not kernel
specific but instead can be generalised at the meta-model level. We
need to create adequate representations in yarn to handle facets,
etc. We then need to move across the code that computes enablement
into yarn so that all kernels can make use of it.

Problems:

- we are checking to see if the hash facet is enabled with c++ 98; if
  so, we throw as this facet is incompatible. We cannot do this from
  yarn since we do not know what c++ standards are.
- because we do not have a mapping between a archetype location and
  the meta-type, we will be enabling/disabling all archetype locations
  across all meta-types.
- because we do not have element segmentation, the element extensions
  will be disabled. Actually this will probably work just the same,
  given that all elements exist.
- enablement must be done after external transformations so it picks
  up fabric types.
- we need to support formatting styles in order to be able to use the
  artefact properties from the meta-model.
- in quilt.cpp, someone did an upfront generation of all archetype
  properties against the archetype locations. We not doing that in
  yarn, so nothing is coming out. This was done during transformation
  in formattables.
- with a move into yarn, we seem to have broken the overwrite flag
  logic; changes no longer result in new code being generated.
- we also have borked the includes: dependency builder is looking into
  the formattables instead of element. However, we then run into
  segmentation issues because we cannot find forward declarations on
  the main element.

To do:

- kernel registrar type index map - done.
- assistant to latch on to element; use new element properties where
  possible.
- facet properties must be handled, and assistant must use the yarn
  version.
- c# formatter registrar type index map - done.
- bug in template instantiating: artefact expansions do not seem to
  take kernel into account - done.
- use new enabled fields.
- delete all enablement classes in c++ and enabled/overwrite properties.

*Previous Understanding*

We need to make use of the exact same logic as implemented in
=quilt.cpp= for enablement. Perhaps all of the enablement related
functionality can be lifted and grafted onto quilt without any major
changes.

*** Tidy-up assistant API                                             :story:

Now we have element in assistant we can start removing the need for
element in the calls, making the templates simpler.

*** Facets incompatible with standards                                :story:

Some facets may not be supported for all settings of a language. For
example the hash facet is not compatible with C++ 98. We need to have
some kind of facet/formatter level validation for this.

*** Handcrafted templates                                             :story:

At present we generate constructors, swap, etc. for handcrafted
classes. Ideally users should be able to create a profile that enables
the things they want to see on a template and then associate it with a
stereotype. For this we will need aspect support.

*** Drop the original extension in tailor                             :story:

Filenames in tailor look weird:

: dart.dia.json

it should just be:

: dart.json

*** Move dependencies into yarn                                       :story:

Actually the dependencies will be generated at the kernel level
because 99% of the code is kernel specific. However, we need to make
it an external transform.

Tasks:

- create the locator in the C++ external transform
- create a dependencies transform that uses the existing include
  generation code.

*Previous understanding*

It seems all languages we support have some form of "dependencies":

- in c++ these are the includes
- in c# these are the usings
- in java these are the imports

So, it would make sense to move these into yarn. The process of
obtaining the dependencies must still be done in a kernel dependent
way because we need to build any language-specific structures that the
dependencies builder requires. However, we can create an interface for
the dependencies builder in yarn and implement it in each kernel. Each
kernel must also supply a factory for the builders.

*** Consider folding quilt into yarn                                  :story:

In the far distant future, when we finally finish merging all the
quilt specific stuff into yarn (e.g. formattables), it actually makes
sense to deprecate quilt as a concept. Yarn then becomes the central
point, and frontends and backends are just implementations that hook
into it. Thus we then have simply =yarn.cpp= and =yarn.csharp=.

However, there is still a concept that needs to be captured: the
kernel. That is, a set of backends that work together to provide some
kind of "service". In quilt's case the basic type definitions. We
could potentially want to implement other backends that are totally
distinct from quilt. However, we still do not have a concrete use case
for this. Thus it may make more sense to just fold now and worry about
these more flexible use cases when they arrive. We can always rename.

*** Use element ids for associations                                  :story:

There doesn't seem a need for having entire names for associations;
these are used to find information by ID anyway. We should try to
convert them to element id's instead and see what breaks.

- transparent, opaque associations
- base, derived visitor
- contained by

We can't do this for:

- visitor: we use the name in the formatter.

*** Code-generate annotations type templates                          :story:

Tasks:

- create a meta-model element for type templates. Add container in
  exomodel for it. Name: =yarn::annotation_type_template=?
- add frontend support for the type template element.
- add a transform that reads all the meta-data from type templates and
  populates the yarn element of the type template. Add this transform
  to the exomodel transforms, at the end of the chain (e.g. after
  annotations).
- create a meta-model element for the initialiser of type templates,
  made up of all type templates in the model. Add a container of
  initialiser in endomodel.
- add a transform that moves all of the type templates into the
  initialiser. This can be done as part of the exomodel to endomodel
  transform. Or maybe we should have a stand alone transform, and the
  final transform simply ignores type templates.
- create a registrar in annotations that registers type templates.
- create a stitch template for the initialiser, taking the registrar
  as an argument, and registering all type templates.
- add all type templates to all models, and generate the type
  initialisers.
- hook the type initialisers to the initialisers.
- change type group repository to initialise from the registrar.
- delete all type groups JSON and hydrator and related code.

Merged stories:

*Initialisation of meta-data*

At present we are reading meta-data files for every transformation. In
reality, it makes no sense to allow the meta-data files to change
dynamically, because the consumers of the meta-data are hard-coded. So
it would make more sense to treat them as a initialisation step. This
will make even more sense when we code-generate the types instead of
using JSON. Then we can hook up the generated code to the
initialisers.

*** Cannot make qualified references to concepts                      :story:

At present it is not possible to consume concepts defined in a
referenced model, nor is it possible to refer to a concept in a
different module from the module in which the element is in, e.g.: say
concept C0 is declared in module M0; all types of M0 can have C0 as
stereotype and that will resolve. However any types on any other
module cannot see the concept.

One suggestion is to allow scoped names in stereotypes:
=module::Concept=.

The heuristic for concept resolution is then:

- external modules are never part of the scoped name;
- on a scoped concept with M names, we first start by assuming that
  the first name is the model module and M-2 is/are the internal
  module(s). We try this for all names in M-2, e.g. first two names
  are model modules and M-3 names are internal modules and so forth.

*** Add support for object templates that work cross-model            :story:

We've implemented support for cross-model inheritance in sprint 87 but
we did not cover object templates. Most of the approach is the same,
but unfortunately we can't just reuse it.

Tasks:

- we need a refines field which is a text collection.
- we need refinement settings, factory etc.
- update parsing expander.

*** Move formatting styles into yarn                                  :story:

We need to support the formatting styles at the meta-model level.

*** Throw on unsupported stereotypes                                  :story:

In some cases we may support a feature in one language but not on
others like say ORM at present. If a user requests ORM in a C# model,
we should throw.

If we are in compatibility mode, however, we should not throw.

Note that we are already throwing if a stereotype is totally
unknown. The problem here is that the stereotype is known, but not
supported for all kernels. This is a bit trickier.

We also need to check the existing code in stereotypes transform to
stop trowing if compatibility flag is on.

*** Change order of includes according to Lakos major design rule     :story:

Lakos says:

#+begin_quote
The .c file of every component should include its own .h file as the
first substantive line of code.
#+end_quote

We decided to include it as the last line. However, Lakos approach has
the side-effect of automatically detecting headers that are missing
includes. We used to do this manually by generating =.cpp= files that
just included the header but then had to remove it because it was
slowing down compilation. With Lakos approach we get the best of both
worlds.

We need to also update the generated code to follow this
approach. This will require some thinking.

*** Move element segmentation into yarn                               :story:

We've added the notion that an element can be composed of other
elements in quilt, in order to handle forward declarations. However,
with a little bit of effort we can generalise it into yarn. It would
be useful for other things such as inner classes. We don't need to
actually implement inner classes right now but we should make sure the
moving of this feature into yarn is compatible with it.

Notes:

- seems like we have two use cases: a) we need all elements, master
  and extensions and we don't really care about which is which. b) we
  only want masters. However, we must be able to access the same
  element properties from either the master or the extension. Having
  said all that, it seems we don't really need all of the element
  properties for both - forward declarations probably only need:
  decoration and artefact properties.
- we don't seem to use the map in formattables model anywhere, other
  than to find master/extension elements.
- Yarn model could have two simple list containers (masters and
  all). Or maybe we don't even need this to start off with, we can
  just iterate and skip extensions where required.
- so in conclusion, we to move decoration, enablement and dependencies
  into yarn (basically decoration and artefact properties) first and
  then see where segmentation ends.

Tasks:

- add a concept for element extensions: =Extensible=. Contains a list
  of element pointers.
- populate it with the extensions.
- change enablement to merge all element properties of extensible
  elements.

*** Create a yarn locator                                             :story:

We need to move all functionality which is not kernel specific into
yarn for the locator. This will exist in the helpers namespace. We
then need to implement the C++ locator as a composite of yarn
locator. It will live in fabric.

*Other Notes*

At present we have multiple calls in locator, which are a bit
ad-hoc. We could potentially create a pattern. Say for C++, we have
the following parameters:

- relative or full path
- include or implementation: this is simultaneously used to determine
  the placement (below) and the extension.
- meta-model element:
- "placement": top-level project directory, source directory or
  "natural" location inside of facet.
- archetype location: used to determine the facet and archetype
  postfixes.

E.g.:

: make_full_path_for_enumeration_implementation

Interestingly, the "placement" is a function of the archetype location
(a given artefact has a fixed placement). So a naive approach to this
seems to imply one could create a data driven locator, that works for
all languages if supplied suitable configuration data. To generalise:

- project directory is common to all languages.
- source or include directories become "project
  sub-directories". There is a mapping between the artefact location
  and a project sub-directory.
- there is a mapping between the artefact location and the facet and
  artefact postfixes.
- extensions are a slight complication: a) we want to allow users to
  override header/implementation extensions, but to do it so for the
  entire project (except maybe for ODB files). However, what yarn's
  locator needs is a mapping of artefact location to  extension. It
  would be a tad cumbersome to have to specify extensions one artefact
  location at a time. So someone has to read a kernel level
  configuration parameter with the artefact extensions and expand it
  to the required mappings. Whilst dealing with this we also have the
  issue of elements which have extension in their names such as visual
  studio projects and solutions. The correct solution is to implement
  these using element extensions, and to remove the extension from the
  element name.
- each kernel can supply its configuration to yarn's locator via the
  kernel interface. This is fairly static so it can be supplied early
  on during initialisation.
- there is still something not quite right. We are performing a
  mapping between some logical space (the modeling space) and the
  physical space (paths in the filesystem). Some modeling elements
  such as the various CMakeLists.txt do not have enough information at
  the logical level to tell us about their location; at present the
  formatter itself gives us this hint ("include cmakelists" or "source
  cmakelists"?). It would be annoying to have to split these into
  multiple archetypes just so we can have a function between the
  archetype location and the physical space. Although, if this is the
  only case of a modeling element not mapping uniquely, perhaps we
  should do exactly this.
- However, we still have inclusion paths to worry about. As we done
  with the source/include directories, we need to somehow create a
  concept of inclusion path which is not language specific; "relative
  path" and "requires relative path" perhaps? These could be a
  function of archetype location.

*** Generate file paths as a transform                                :story:

Add a fabric transform for file path generation.

*** Add a modeline to stitch                                          :story:

It would be nice to be able to supply the mode and other emacs
properties to stitch templates. For that we just need a special KVP
used at the top that contains the modeline:

: <#@ modeline="-*- mode: poly-stitch; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; -*-" #>

Stitch can read this KVP and ignore it.

*** Create "opaque" kernel and element properties                     :story:

As part of the element container, we can have a set of base classes
that are empty: =opaque_element_properties=. This class is then
specialised in each kernel with the properties that are specific to
it. We probably need an equivalent for:

- kernel level properties
- element level properties
- attribute level properties.

We then have to do a lot of casting in the helpers.

Once we got these opaque properties, we can then create "kernel
specific expanders" which are passed in to the yarn workflow. These
populate the opaque properties.

*** Move helpers into yarn                                            :story:

Looking at helpers, it is clear that they are common to all
languages. We just need to rename the terminology slightly -
particularly wrt to streaming properties - and then move this code
across into yarn.

*** Move facet properties into yarn                                   :story:

We should be able to handle these generically in yarn.

*** Move ORM camel-case and databases into yarn                       :story:

We should handle this property at the ORM level, rather than at the
ODB level.

Similarly, we should move the ODB databases into yarn and make that a
ORM-level concept.

*** Distinguish between meta-types that require canonical archetypes  :story:

At present it is not possible to know which meta-types require
canonical archetypes and which don't. In the validation we said:

:         * We must have one canonical formatter per type per facet.
:         * FIXME: this check is broken at the moment because this is
:         * only applicable to yarn types, not fabric types. It is also
:         * not applicable to forward declarations. We need some
:         * additional information from yarn to be able to figure out
:         * which types must have a canonical archetype.

We should have some kind of flag in yarn to distinguish. This still
requires a bit of thinking.

*** Tidy-up of inclusion terminology                                  :story:

Random notes:

- imports and exports
- some types support both (headers)
- some support imports only (cpp)
- some support neither (cmakelists, etc).

** Deprecated
*** Add logging to all top-level workflow activities                  :story:

We need to make sure the log file is narrating a story. For this we
need to add logging to all start and end of activities by the
workflows. This means that when we filter by workflow name we should
be able to quickly figure out where things went wrong.

*** Add logging to test suite                                         :story:

At present its not possible to figure out where a test suite starts or
ends in the log file. We should also move the asserts from =DEBUG= to
=TRACE=, unless there is an error.
