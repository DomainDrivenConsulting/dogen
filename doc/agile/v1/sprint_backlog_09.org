Title: Dogen v1.0.08, "Caminhada"

#+begin_src markdown
![Caminhada](https://i2.wp.com/cookthebeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_5465.jpg) _Long walk towards a traditional village, Huambo, Angola. [(C) Ana Rocha 2017](https://cookthebeans.com/2017/03/09/benguela-huambo-bie-in-the-route-of-angolas-up-country)_.

# Overview

After a rather long hiatus of some nine months, Dogen development resumes once more. In truth, the break was only related to the open source aspect of the Dogen project; behind the scenes I have been hard at work on my PhD, which has morphed into an attempt to lay the theoretical foundations for all the software engineering that has been done with Dogen. Sadly, I cannot perform that work out in the open until the thesis or papers are published, so it is expected to remain closed for at least another year or two.

On the bright side, after performing an extensive literature review of the field of [Model Driven Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) - the technical name used in academia for the field Dogen is in - a lot of what we have been trying to do has finally become clear. The down side is that, as a result of all of this theoretical work, very little has changed with regards to the code during this period. As such, this sprint contains only some minor analysis work that was done in parallel, and I am closing it just avoid conflating it with the new work going forward.

The future for Dogen is bright, though. We are now starting the long road towards the very ambitious release that will be Dogen 2.0. The objective is to sync the code to match all of the work done on the theory side. This work as already started; you will not fail to notice that the repository has been moved to the _MASD project_ - Model Assisted Software Development.

User visible changes
================

There are no user visible changes this sprint.

Next Sprint
===========

The next few sprints will be extremely active, addressing a number of long standing issues such as moving test models outside of the main repo and concluding ongoing refactorings.

Binaries
======

Due to the transition of organisations, we did not generate any binaries for this release. As there are no code changes, please use the binaries for the previous release ([v1.0.07](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.07)) or build Dogen from source. Source downloads are available at the top.

Now that dogen is under MASD, we have a number of links that are
pointing to the old Domain Driven Consulting org. Update those.

*** COMPLETED Analysis on reducing build times to avoid timeouts      :story:
    CLOSED: [2018-10-03 Wed 10:40]

Refactoring at the moment is painful because every time we change
CMakeFiles we end up rebuilding everything. At 2K plus ninja targets,
it is a long wait. In addition, we have been getting really close to
the maximum travis time, resulting in lots of manual fiddling to get
things to work. However, there is one very easy win: split test models
from production code. This is more than just a quick hack, really:

- we are compiling the test models with every build at present, but
  since they are not production code, we only really need to validate
  them whenever they change. That is - for a given OS, compiler, etc -
  once a test model compiles, links and its tests run, nothing else
  needs to be said until the test model changes.
- test models change very infrequently; only when we do a breaking
  change on Dogen and we rebase.
- test models by definition do not reference production code (or at
  least, /should/ not).

As a first step we should try to isolate the two builds (production,
test models) via variables so that we can create separate
travis/appveyor builds for them. In the future we should make the
separation even more explicit, by moving the folder away from the
production code.

*Previous Understanding*

At present we get random build time violations on travis due to builds
taking longer than 50 mins. We need to think of ways to reduce the
build time. Things to try:

- remove all of the hashing etc for the types we don't need to hash.
- get rid of the warnings for boost.

*** STARTED Create project for C# test model                          :story:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2018-10-03 Wed 10:42]--[2018-10-03 Wed 10:44] =>  0:02
    :END:

We need to create a separate repo for the C# test model. This also
means we need to generate the LAM model in two different locations.

*** Create the =generation= model                                     :story:

Create a new model called =generation= and move all code-generation
related class to it.

We need to create classes for element properties and make model have a
collection that is a pair of element and element properties. We need a
good name for this pair:

- extended element
- augmented element
- decorated element: though not using the decorator pattern; also, we
  already have decoration properties so this is confusing.

Alternatively we could just call it =element= and make it contain a
modeling element.

Approach:

- create a new generation model, copying across all of the meta-model
  and transform classes from yarn. Get the model to transform from
  endomodel to generation model.
- augment formattables with the new element properties. Supply this
  data via the context or assistant.

Problems:

- all of the transforms assume access to the modeling element means
  access to the generation properties. However, with the introduction
  of the generation element we now have a disconnect. For example, we
  sometimes sort and bucket the elements, and then modify them; this
  no longer works with generation elements because these are not
  pointers. It would be easier to make the generation properties a
  part of the element. This is an ongoing discussion we've had since
  the days of formattables. However, in formattables we did write all
  of the transforms to take into account the formattable contained
  both the element and the formattable properties, whereas now we need
  to update all transforms to fit this approach. This is a lot more
  work. The quick hack is to slot in the properties directly into the
  element as some kind of "opaque properties". We could create a base
  class =opaque_properties= and then have a container of these in
  element. However, to make it properly extensible, the only way is to
  make it a unordered set of pointers.
