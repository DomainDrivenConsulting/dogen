Title: Dogen v0.99.0, "Cine Estúdio"

#+begin_src markdown
![Cine Estúdio](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5188/3180/1600/blog_IMG_0530.jpg)The unfinished Cine Estúdio, Namibe, Angola. (C) Blog O Desterro do Arquitecto, in [blogspot](http://odesterrodoarquitecto.blogspot.co.uk/2006/07/o-cine-estudio-do-namibe.html).

Overview
=======
This sprint was mainly focused on improving our ORM/ODB support. We have continued our series of posts on it, with the third part of the series:

- [Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part III](http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html)

We have also improved testing around a few areas:

- all of the meta-data settings for paths and directories, fixing a few bugs in the process.
- LAM: language agnostic models have now basic coverage and should work for both C# and C++.
- ODB: the northwind project saw significant activity, as narrated in the blog posts.

Finally, the other significant feature added in this sprint is support for C++ 98: It is now possible to generate models which do not use any of the C++ 11 (and above features).

User visible changes
===============
In this sprint, a number of user visible changes were made:

- **Split directory**: this feature was resurrected; it is now possible to place the include directory in a location other than the main project directory.
- **Improvements in the ORM layer**: more features were added and quite a few fixes. See the [northwind](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/09d7f7cd40b29ed0dded559b75d9dbcbad52f777/projects/input_models/northwind.dia) model for an example.
- **C++ standard is now settable**: users can now choose C++ 98 or C++ 11/14 as the standard and the generated code will be compliant.

For more details of the work carried out this sprint, see the [sprint log](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/sprint_backlog_099.org).

Next Sprint
========
In the next sprint we'll wrap things up with our ODB work and start adding Visual Studio support.

*** COMPLETED Header directory is not part of housekeeping            :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-03-21 Tue 11:46]

    CLOCK: [2017-03-21 Tue 11:02]--[2017-03-21 Tue 11:46] =>  0:44

At present the housekeeper is not deleting files in the header
directory.

*** COMPLETED Disable common support on ODB for a single database     :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-03-21 Tue 12:09]
    CLOCK: [2017-03-21 Tue 12:01]--[2017-03-21 Tue 12:09] =>  0:08

We are always enabling common regardless of how many database systems
the user has requested. Similar with multiple database support. We
should disable all of this (at least for now) on the single database
scenario.

*** STARTED Implement the database model using Northwind              :story:
    CLOCK: [2017-03-20 Mon 20:45]--[2017-03-20 Mon 22:43] =>  1:58

Now we are using Dogen in anger with ODB, we need to make sure the
database model is actually exercising all of this functionality. One
easy way of achieving this is to use Microsoft's Northwind Database as
the base for the model.

- [[https://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/][Northwind Database]]

We should implement it using Oracle and use this to test the changes
to ODB's oracle support.

Tasks:

- add comment for ODB targets
- add flag to mark a type as a value
- case of the identifiers is a problem: sometimes we get them
  uppercase (when we do them without quotes in sql plus) sometimes we
  get them lowercase (from odb). use =--sql-name-case= upper/lower as
  a flag.
- schema initialisation from statics is not working; this is as
  explained in [[http://www.codesynthesis.com/pipermail/odb-users/2013-May/001286.html][this email]]. We can force it by doing a query on that
  entity, but that then causes an exception.

*** STARTED Allow users to override string prefixes in test data      :story:
    CLOCK: [2017-03-21 Tue 07:10]--[2017-03-21 Tue 07:24] =>  0:14
    CLOCK: [2017-03-21 Tue 06:41]--[2017-03-21 Tue 07:04] =>  0:23

At present we have a hard-coded string prefix in test data:
=a_string_". This has been is fine up to now, but we have bumped into
a problem when using it with ORM: some fields in the database are too
small to fit the prefix (e.g. =VARCHAR[5]=). The quick solution for
this is to make the prefix customisable when we instantiate the
generator.

Actually this is not quite that straightforward: in order to allow
users to configure the string prefix, we'd have to extend all helpers
to have a "prefix" argument of type string because we do not know
which helpers are the string helpers. An alternative is to have a test
data configuration, with the following configurable points:

- string prefix
- path prefix
- numeric start
- date start

The configuration is an optional parameter supplied to the
generator. If empty we use the default configuration which could
potentially be read from meta-data, although we do not have a use case
for this.

However, we have a slight problem: if a model M0 has types from
another model M1, we will end up with two configurations (one per
model). When we call a M0 generator which calls an M1 generator, we
need to somehow send the configuration across as well. Since they are
different types (even though identical in layout) we need to copy the
configuration across. This could be achieved with a template
method. Alternatively we could make all helper methods a template
method that takes in a configuration:

#+begin_src c++
template<typename Configuration>
create_XYZ(unsigned int position, const Configuratio& c) {
...
}
#+end_src

Actually this won't work: we still have the problem of calling
external generators.

A simpler but less typed solution is to use =std::tuple=:

: std::tuple<std::string, std::string, int, int> configuration

The other interesting point is that this is perhaps an ORM
problem. After all, we could have a =VARCHAR[2]= string, and
configuring the prefix won't help. What we really need is to figure
out how many digits one can put in the string, given the available
size. Users can supply the sizes as part of the ORM configuration. We
can then do a simple heuristic:

- does the prefix fit? if not, drop it.
- what is the max value for the counter that will fit the string size?
  Use it as a modulus.

Tasks:

- inject a new fabric type for test data configuration. It can be a
  simple struct.

*** STARTED Concepts cannot be placed inside of packages              :story:

At present it is not possible to create a concept inside a
package or reuse concepts across models. This is because we do not
resolve the refines container of a concept, or the models container of
an object. We could trivially add resolution to concept expansion but
we do not have a use case for this yet. The approach should be similar
to what we did for generalisation expansion: call the
resolver. However, we need to refactor the resolver because we need to
use the same algorithm but this time on the concepts container.

*Previous Understanding*

#+begin_quote
*Story*: As a dogen user, I want to place concepts in packages so that
I can scope them when required.
#+end_quote

At present it is not possible to create a concept inside a
package. This is because the concept qualified name is assumed to be
at top-level. In the future it may be useful to use scoping for
concept names in the stereotype. We do not yet have a use case for
this.

This can be done trivially by:

- allowing (or forcing?) the stereotype to have the package path;
- using the package path in stereotype expansion when constructing the
  concept name.

Merged stories:

*Concepts do not work in namespaces*

We just fail to resole them and do not even throw an error.

We can either always place concepts on the model namespace or we can
fix resolver to default to current scope.

*** ODB options does not cater for types placed in namespaces         :story:

At present the regexes assume the types are placed on the top-level
ODB directory.

*** Types in namespaces do not have ORM properties applied            :story:

We seem to be missing the schema and in some cases primary key too.

*** Ignore ODB files automatically                                    :story:

At present we are adding the following regular expressions to knitter
whenever we are using ODB with dogen:

:        --ignore-files-matching-regex .*sql
:        --ignore-files-matching-regex .*-odb.*)

We should inject the ODB files automatically into the list of expected
files. For a given element =foreign_key=, we will have a dogen file

: foreign_key_pragmas.hpp

We will also have the following ODB files:

: foreign_key-odb.cxx
: foreign_key-odb.hxx
: foreign_key-odb.ipp
: foreign_key-odb.ixx

The first file can either be on the =include/odb= directory or on the
=src/odb= directory (it is moved by the ODB target). All other files
are placed in the =include/odb= folder. Note that at present we are
using =cpp= extension rather than =cxx=.

In addition, on a multi-database environment we also have:

- =repository-odb-oracle.hxx=
- =repository-odb-pgsql.hxx=
- ...

Ideally we should also add the ODB include files to the master
includes. However, we probably need a separate master include file
just for ODB files.

One of the amazing side-effects of this approach is that we will
automatically delete any ODB files which are no longer required
(because we will not generate ignores for them). At present we are
manually deleting them.

*** Check for incompatibility between input language and enabled kernels :story:

At present it is possible to have a model with input language of say
C++ but with the C# kernel enabled. We should throw if the input
language is incompatible with the enabled kernels.

Sadly this is not trivial. This is because quilt only sees the mapped
models; thus as far as knit is concerned, we ask for the input
language (e.g. c++) and there is an enabled kernel for it. We don't
look at it from the enabled kernel's perspective (e.g. "C# is enabled,
why is there no input language for it?"). We could have a method in
quilt that returns all enabled kernels; we could then look at all
models we are going to build and if there is a mismatch we can
throw. But extracting the =configuration_factory= out of quilt
workflow is not going to be easy without screwing up the API.

*** Build on tags for Windows                                         :story:

At present we are not building and deploying for tags on Windows. This
is a major pain because it means we must remember to always push the
tag separately. We need to setup appveyor correctly.

Links:

- [[http://help.appveyor.com/discussions/problems/6209-build-is-not-triggered-for-tag][Build is not triggered for tag]]

*** Add a "flat directory" mode                                       :story:

It would be nice to have a mode in which all files get placed in a
single-directory: no src, include, etc – just one big folder with all
files.

Actually we can already achieve this:

- set =quilt.cpp.disable_facet_directories= to true
- set =quilt.cpp.include_directory_name= to empty
- set =quilt.cpp.source_directory_name= to empty

It is however a bit painful. It would be nice to have a shorthand for
this, which could be the "flat directory" mode. It is also compatible
with split project mode (we just have flat directories in two
different top-level directories), which is nice.

We should check that =enable_unique_file_names= is set to true.

*** Handling of visual studio projects and solutions is incorrect     :story:

At present we added the extension of the solution/project to the
element name, e.g.:

: all_path_and_directory_settings.csproj

This happens to work for the simpler cases, but if we try to add a
postfix we then have a problem:

: dogen.test_models.all_path_and_directory_settings.csproj_vc15_

Projects and solutions do not seem to fit our conceptual model for the
element space. We need to somehow have distinct element IDs but yet
not associate the extension with the name directly. Up to now we never
had two distinct elements with the exact same name but generating two
different artefacts with different extensions.

This is a problem because we will need to have the ability to generate
multiple project files for different versions of visual studio.

For now we removed the project and solution postfixes:

: #DOGEN quilt.csharp.visual_studio.solution.postfix=_vs15_
: #DOGEN quilt.csharp.visual_studio.project.postfix=_vc15_

In order to fit our conceptual model, we need to make some adjustments
to our implementation of projects and solutions. First, there is only
one meta-model element for *both* projects and solutions. This is
derived from the fact that they both share a common name. The
conceptual model does not involve file extensions - or file paths for
that matter; archetypes exist only in archetype space, and their
"paths" in this space are only related to the facets they belong
to. The physical location is a property of files, which are
expressions of archetypes in "file space". Thus, there is only one
single element, provisionally called "visual studio", which has
multiple archetypes (and their associated formatters):

- solution
- project

Second, a solution and project may be instantiated multiple times,
depending on the version of visual studio and the associated
compiler. Externally users supply a visual studio version and that
internally will map to different instances of the formatters. We must
instantiate the formatters for each supported version because we may
need to create multiple versions simultaneously: his is the use case
where users want to generate projects and solutions for multiple
versions of VS at the same time.

THe good news is that we already have something similar: master
includes. We can adapt a lot of the logic we have for master
includes. There are some differences though:

- we will have multiple instances on the same facet.
- we need some external mechanism to determine if a given version is
  enabled. We could force users to enter the "enabled" property for
  each version in the meta-data, but that would get really messy since
  there are only a few valid combinations of solution and project
  version. Its better if users supply the Visual Studio versions and
  we infer the solution and projects to enable. But we do not have a
  mechanism for this at present. We could add a "is enabled" to
  formatters like we did for helpers, supplying the element; we would
  then check the Visual Studio version in the element and return false
  if it didn't match the formatters version. Or we could change the
  formatter's interface to return optional artefact. Whilst this is a
  bit more painful - we'd have to change all formatters - it fits the
  code structure slightly better.
- we need to have different file names depending on the
  version. Worse: if there is just a single version we do not need to
  have a "version prefix". If there are multiple versions we need to
  add the prefix. The fist use case is easy: we already have archetype
  prefixes; we just need to add a prefix for each version. The second
  part requires some hacking. We could have an option in locator:
  "apply archetype postfix" supplied as an argument. Since we have the
  Visual Studio element we have visibility of all enabled versions.

*** Add column name support to ORM                                    :story:

At present we need to fall back to ODB pragmas in order to rename a
column. We should have =yarn.orm.column_name=.

*** Setting include and source directory to empty                     :story:

At present it does not seem possible to set either the include or
source directories to empty. This probably just requires annotations
to understand empty values, e.g.

: a.b.c=

*** Drop the "c++-" prefix in meta-data for standard                  :story:

At present we do:

: quilt.cpp.standard=c++-98

The "c++-" seems a bit redundant.

*** Objects without primary keys do not have =no_id= set              :story:

Previously we were automatically adding the ODB pragma =no_id= to
objects that had no primary key set. This no longer seems to be
happening.

*** Rename main Dogen package in Debian                               :story:

At present we seem to have called our package =dogen-applications=:

: $ apt-cache search dogen-applications
: dogen-applications - The Domain Generator - Generates source code for domain driven development.

We should try to call it just =dogen=.

*** Split out the file extension from the formatter                   :story:

At present we have handled file extensions in one of two ways:

- we baked them in into locator, dynamically: this is the case for
  =hpp= and =cpp=, where locator is responsible for retrieving the
  meta-data related to extensions.
- we hacked them in into locator, statically: this is the case for
  CMakeLists, where the =txt= is hard-coded in.
- we hacked them in into the elements: this is the case for Visual
  Studio solutions and projects.

In reality, what we need is to create a separation between the
archetype, the extension "kind" and the actual extension. All
archetypes have a fixed "extension kind". For example, C++ headers
will always have a C++ header extension even though the actual header
extension used is not known. In other cases the extension kind has a
fixed extension (CMakeLists, Visual Studio projects, solutions). At
present this mapping is done via the multiple functions locator
supplies.

We could conceivably have an enumeration for extension kind and then
have a single function for full paths, that just takes in the
extension kind, archetype etc. This would replace the proliferation of
"full path for XYZ".

We also have the concept of inclusion paths. We should generalise this
to just "relative paths" and have a "add project directory?" flag.

*** Name all project paths according to a scheme                      :story:

The locator API looks really confusing due to the various kinds of
paths. We need to catalogue them all and name them properly.

- output directory: directory into which knitter will write all files,
  unless "c++ headers output directory" is set, in which case it will
  write all files except for the headers.
- c++ headers output directory: directory in which knitter will write
  the headers. Only applicable to c++.
- include directory: aka inclusion directory; directory to place in
  the include path.

*** Start signing all tags                                            :story:

We should really be signing all git tags.

*** Not setting output language results in weird errors               :story:

When setting the input language to language agnostic and not setting
the output languages, we get the following error:

*** Using underscores with C# results in invalid code                 :story:

When building in LAM, if one uses underscore notation we create code
like so:

:        public int prop_0 { get; set; }
:        public class_0(int prop_0)
:        {
:            prop_0 = prop_0;
:        }

C# thinks we're assigning the parameter to itself rather than making
use of the property.

*** Support containers correctly in annotations                       :story:

At present we are allowing users to enter the same key multiple times
to represent a container:

: #DOGEN yarn.output_language=cpp
: #DOGEN yarn.output_language=csharp


This was an acceptable pattern from a Dia perspective, because we had
control of the KVP semantics. However, when we copied the pattern
across to the JSON representation things did not work out so
well. This is because the following JSON:

:     "yarn.output_language": "csharp",
:     "yarn.output_language": "cpp",

Is interpreted by a lot of JSON parsers as a duplicate, and results on
only a single KVP making it. We could try to solve a lot of problems
in one go and standardise all of the meta-data on JSON:

- use start and end markers to enclose the JSON when in dia. Story:
  [[https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org#consider-adding-a-start-and-end-dogen-variable-block-in-dia][Consider adding a start and end dogen variable block in dia]]
- this would also solve the problem with pairs (or at least part of
  it). Story: [[https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/sprint_backlog_99.org#add-a-new-annotation-type-of-pair][Add a new annotation type of “pair”]]
- we could allow users to keep the JSON externally. Story: [[https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/sprint_backlog_99.org#add-support-for-one-off-profiles][Add support
  for “one off” profiles]]
- the JSON would also work nicely with the concept of a dogen
  project. Story: [[https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/sprint_backlog_99.org#introduce-dogen-projects][Introduce dogen projects]]

However, before we embark on this story we need to perform a lot of
analysis on this.

Notes:

- [[http://json-schema.org/][JSON Schema]]
- [[https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Project.json-file][Project.Json]]
- yarn.dia.comment is no longer necessary, just look for the
  markers.
- we should only allow arrays of simple types.
- the fragment used inside Dia should be identical to the file
  supplied as argument for the one-off profile and it should also
  identical to a fragment inside a project. Do we need to support both
  projects and one-off profiles?

Sample:

#+begin_src
  "annotation": {
    "yarn.dia.comment": true,
    "yarn.dia.external_modules": "dogen::test_models",
    "annotations.profile": "dogen",
    "yarn.input_language": "language_agnostic",
    "yarn.output_language": [ "csharp", "cpp" ]
#+end_src

*** Add support for exports on windows                                :story:

We should add export macros for shared objects/DLLs for windows. We
should create a file =exports.hpp= probably at top-level with all the
exports.

#+begin_example
#pragma once

#ifdef MODEL_DECL
    #undef MODEL _DECL
#endif

#ifdef MODEL _EXPORTS
    #define MODEL _DECL __declspec(dllexport)
#else
    #define MODEL _DECL __declspec(dllimport)
#endif
#+end_example

It is used as follows:

: class MODEL_DECL Tags xxx

*** Add =targetver.h= support                                         :story:

On windows we should be generating the targetver header.

Links:

- [[https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/blob/master/Samples/RadialController/cpp/targetver.h][targetver.h]]

*** Add support for DLL Main on windows                               :story:

At present we are manually generating DLL Main by hand and then
excluding it on regexes. This is not ideal and will be more of a
problem when we generate project files. Ideally we should code
generate it. Requirements:

- user must be able to disable it;
- user must be able to handcraft it in case they want different
  contents;

Links:

- [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370448(v%3Dvs.85).aspx][DLL Main]]

*** Add support for pre-compiled headers on windows                   :story:

Most VS users have pre-compiled headers. We need to generate
=stdafx.h= etc. For now we can have it minimally populated until we
understand better the requirements.

Actually we could probably do a very simple computation in quilt to
figure out the most frequently used headers and add those to
=stdafx=. We just need to go through the entire model in the inclusion
expander to perform this calculation.

In addition we need to make sure =stdafx= is added as the first
include.

We should have a quilt setting for pre-compilation. We should also
check that visual studio support is enabled in order to generate
=stdafx=.

*** Add support for Visual Studio C++ projects                        :story:

Visual studio project needs the files to be listed by hand. We can
either generate the project or the user has to manually add the
files. This is a problem every time they change. Requirements:

- we need to be able to support multiple VS versions as well (user
  configurable)
- user may want to import property sheets
- need guids (as per C# projects)
- need additional library/include directories
- need to add pre-compiled headers support with /FI.
- add a solution for good measure, using the C# code.
- add filter files for headers and source files.

As per ODB, users may also want to build with different versions of
VS. We should allow generating more than one solution and postfix them
with the VS version.

We should also generate filters for the project:

- header files
- source files
- ODB header files
- ODB source files

The inclusion of ODB files must be done using regular expressions
because we do not want to have to do two passes for knit; so we don't
really know what files are available. However, if the ODB files have a
=cxx= extension, we can just =CLInclude= =*cxx=.

*** Add a top-level "Visual Studio" knob                              :story:

We have a number of features that only make sense when on Windows and
building for Visual Studio. We should have a top-level knob that
enables or disables all of these features in one go:

- =quilt.cpp.visual_studio.enabled=

*** Handcrafted support for fabric types                              :story:

At present we can either disable fabric types or enable them
(CMakeLists, etc). However, there is a third common use case: to
handcraft them. To do this we normally disable them and then add the
file to the ignore list:

:  --ignore-files-matching-regex .*/CMakeLists.txt)

One could conceive of some meta-data support that would make this
process a tad easier and more generic:

: quilt.cpp.cmakelists.stereotypes=handcrafted

Then hopefully the existing pipeline would take over and we'd generate
the files for the first time but then let the user overwrite it. This
would also be applicable to all fabric types (registrar, etc) but we'd
have to manually read each stereotype on each factory.

*** Use =cxx= extension with ODB files                                :story:

At present we renamed the ODB extension to =.cpp=. This is to make the
ODB files part of the project:

: set(files "")
: file(GLOB_RECURSE files RELATIVE
:    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/"
:    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/*.cpp")

However, it's quite nice to have distinct extensions for ODB and Dogen
files. We should add a conditional in CMake that detects ODB and if
found adds:

: set(odb_files "")
: file(GLOB_RECURSE odb_files RELATIVE
:    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/"
:    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/*.cxx")
: set(files ${files} ${odb_files})

*** Clean up annotation scope types                                   :story:

As part of the attribute rename (which used to be called property) we
should have renamed the annotation scope as well to attribute.

In addition, we have a scope type of "entity" but the yarn meta-model
type is really "element".

We should also check if "not applicable" scope is in use, and if not
delete it.

*** Add a new annotation type of "pair"                               :story:

It would be nice to be able to declare a annotation type with a value
type of "pair" or "key value pair" and have the annotations
automatically perform the splitting. The separator should not be
equals, since we already use that for annotations kvps, but it could
be comma, pipe, etc. The API would be augmented to return a
=std::pair= with key and value.

One slight snag: the value could be of any type:

- boolean
- string
- enumeration (when we support these)
- even text collection

We can start by just supporting strings, but probably worthwhile
having a think on how to specify the type.

*** Create a base options class across all tools                      :story:

At present we are copying and pasting a bit of code related to general
options across all the command line tools (knitter, darter, stitcher,
tailor). We could create a base class that has the common options and
then have a factory that populates the boost program options
associated with that class.

Ideally we should also have a log initialisation class that uses those
common options.

*** Introduce dogen projects                                          :story:

At present we are manually configuring each dogen target, adding each
separately to the build system. Perhaps a better approach is to have a
dogen project file where one can configure all of the targets in one
go. We don’t necessarily have to call dogen directly – perhaps another
command line tool is responsible for invoking dogen? The problem here
is that we’d end up with all dogen models in memory.

At any rate, the project file would contain all models for a given
product. We could possibly run with “all” or “specific” whereby the
user would supply one or more projects to code generate. For all
properties that are common, we’d defined them only once somehow
(common regexes, log level, etc).

*** Add support for "one off" profiles                                :story:

At present one can define top-level profiles. These are useful, but in
practice we ended up still defining a lot of things in each model. We
need a way to associate a profile with a model by supplying it on the
command line. That way users can create profiles and store them next
to the model rather than having to create a data directory, etc etc.

*** Add option to capitalise column and table names                   :story:

One very useful thing is to allow users to define types in camel case
or underscore separated but then have the ODB names generated all in
caps (schema name, table name, column name). The database we are
currently working with is all in caps and we are forced to manually
enter pragmas for every single type because of this. Instead, we
should have some meta-data:

: odb.use_capitals=true

This would automatically generate the pragmas.

One slight downside is that if a user then tries to manually override
the pragmas, we will have duplicates, in effect:

: #DOGEN odb_pragma=schema("northwind")
: #DOGEN odb_pragma=schema("NORTHWIND")

*** Add prefetch support to ODB                                       :story:

As per Boris email:

#+begin_quote
Hm, I am not sure the bulk approach (with a compiler-time pragma) is
right in this case. There we don't really have a choice since we need
to know the "batch buffer" size.

But here it is all runtime. Plus, you may want to have different
prefetch for different queries of the same object. In fact, you
can already customize it for queries (but not for object loads)
by using prepared queries (Section 4.5 in the manual):

1. Create prepared query.

2. Get its statement (statement()).

3. Cast it to odb::oracle::select_statement.

4. Call handle() on the result to get OCIStmt*.

5. Set custom OCI_ATTR_PREFETCH_ROWS.

6. Execute the query.

The problems with this approach are: (1) it is tedious and (2) it
doesn't work for non-query SELECT's (e.g., database::load()). So
perhaps the way to do it is:

1. Provide prefetch() functions on oracle::database() and
   oracle::connection() that can be used to modify database-wide
   and connection-wide prefetch values. Also set it to some
   reasonable default (say 512?)

2. Provide oracle::select_statement::prefetch() to make the
   prepared query approach less tedious.

*** Replace the database model with the northwind model               :story:

As part of the [[https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/zango][zango]] project we are creating a model that exercises
Dogen and ODB. It is largely based on the database model, minus the
basic types we had added a while ago. We should just drop the database
model and adopt the northwind model from zango.

*** Add ODB to the build machine                                      :story:

At present we are only compiling and running the ODB tests
locally. Now that ODB is becoming a core dependency, we need to make
sure we are running these tests on the build machines - Windows and
Linux at least.

*** Rename ODB parameters                                             :story:

At present we use the following form:

: #DOGEN ODB_PRAGMA=no_id

We need to use the new naming style =cpp.odb.pragma=. We also need to
rename the opaque_parameters to reflect ODB specific data.

Finally we should no longer attempt to derive the ODB pragma
context. We should just add it verbatim.

*** Map upsilon primitives to intrinsics                              :story:

Upsilon allows users to create "strong typedefs" around primitve
types. We need to unpack these into their intrinsic counterparts and
them map the intrinsics to native types.

Slight mistake: we mapped the primitive types themselves but in
reality what needs to be mapped are the fields making references to
the primitive types. We should just filter out all primitives.

Additional wrinkle: what the end users want is to unpack "real
primitives" into intrinsics, but "other" primitives should be mapped
to objects. This can be achieved by hard-coding =Plaform= primitives
into the mapping layer. However, some non-platform primitives may also
be candidates too. We need to create a list of these to see how
widespread the problem is.

Another alternative is to apply hard-coded regexes:

- if the name matches any of the intrinsic names

Finally, the last option may be to have yet another mapping data file
format that lists the primitives to unbox.

*** Immutable types cannot be owned by mutable types                  :story:

When we try to create a mutable class that has a property of an
immutable type, the code fails to compile due to the swap
method. This is because immutable types do not provide swap.
