# Overview

**Dogen** is a suite of tools focusing on bringing
[Model Driven Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_software_development) (MDSD)
workflows to C++ development. It is also largely inspired by
the [Domain Driven Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domain-driven_design) (DDD)
methodology, albeit it is not strictly necessary to follow the DDD
approach in order to use it.

In lay terms, our main objective is to automate the modeling process
as much as possible: the user creates domain models in one of the
supported front-end formats and respecting a set of predefined
restrictions; Dogen then uses this input to generate a source code
representation of the model. At present the main front-end
is [Dia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dia_(software)), but we also
support JSON
([Dia test models](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/tree/master/test_data/yarn.dia/input),
[JSON test models](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/tree/master/test_data/yarn.json/input)). Depending
on use cases and user demand, other frontends may follow. The
generated code contains most of the functionality required from a
typical C++ domain object such as serialisation, hashing, streaming
and so on. Whilst we intend for the suite to be useful out of the box
for most use cases, our end goal is enable users to extend Dogen,
adapting it to the vagaries of their specific use cases.

Please note that **the code generated by dogen is C++-11 only.**

# Binary Packages

We have started to provide experimental binary packages on BinTray. At present we only support Debian Linux and OSX. The packages are generated at the end of each sprint.

# Building From Source

To build Dogen on Linux and OSX you need a moderately recent compiler
such as GCC 4.7 or clang 3.7 and a very recent version of Boost:
ideally 1.62. Older Boost versions work, but require patches. See
our
[patches directory](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/tree/master/patches).

Once you have Boost installed, you can simply do:

```
git clone git@github.com:DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen.git
cd dogen/build
mkdir output
cd output
cmake ../..
make -j5 # number of cores available
```

If you have installed Boost on a non-standard location, you need to
add ```CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH``` and ```CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH``` to the
commands above:

```
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/my/boost/include/path CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/my/boost/lib/path cmake ../..
```

Please note that **we don't officially support Windows at present**,
but we are keen to do so in the future. Dogen builds under Visual
Studio 2015 and a recent version of Boost (as per above). You also
need to install [git](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
and [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/). Once all the dependencies
have been installed, the build is similar to Linux (assuming a msysgit
shell, but CMD/Powershell should work fine too):

```
git clone git@github.com:DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen.git
cd dogen/build
mkdir output
cd output
cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G 'Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64'
cmake --build . --config Release --target ALL_BUILD
```

# Demo

At present we don't have a recent demo of Dogen, but this fairly old
one should give you an idea of its workflow.

## Problems

If you have a failure building Dogen or running its unit tests, please
submit a bug report that includes:

- the error messages;
- the compiler and Boost version;
- the Operative System.

If you find a bug whilst using Dogen, please send the compressed log
file as well; it is located under the directory where you executed
Dogen and named ```dogen.knitter.MODEL.log``` where ```MODEL``` is the
name of the model you ran against.

Bugs can be submitted
using [github Issues](https://github.com/kitanda/dogen/issues).
