The varibility model is responsible for managing variation in MASD.

One of the core principles of MASD is to enable the development of
"families" of software products; that is, sets of products which share
similar "traits". Those traits are encoded as "configuration" so that
we can talk about them at a higher level of abstraction. This approach
is often referred to in the literature as Software Product Line
Engineering (SPLE). MASD takes a very simplistic view of SPLE,
allowing a very restricted form of variation across a set of
well-defined features. The present model provides the basic
infrastructure required to define features, as well as to read those
features from dynamic data structures.

Note that the present model only concerns itself with the low-level
implementation of variability. You can think of it as a stack, with
this model sitting at the bottom. Above it lie the logical
representation of variability, which enables the code generator to
generate code that makes use of the infrastructure provided by this
model. But the present model is designed to be understood in complete
isolation from the layers above (and in fact, precedes the generalised
approach).

The variability space is indirectly connected to the physical dimension.
The main reason why is because we need to instantiate features across
the geometry of physical space (e.g. "for every facet...", "for every
archetype...", etc). However, we have tried to avoid coupling these two
models together because we do not think that conceptually this coupling
makes sense. That is, it just happens that we instantiate features across
the geometry of physical space, but this is not a concern o veriability -
only of its user. This decoupling was achieved by creating the concept
of template instantiation domains, which are just sets. These are mapped
elsewhere from the geometry of physical space.
