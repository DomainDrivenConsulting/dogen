/**
 * @brief Transform that specialises in indexing
 * object-template-related relationships across the model.
 *
 * @section yarn_object_templates_expander_0 Model requirements
 *
 * The object templates transform expects to receive a merged
 * endmodel, but in practice it makes no requirements in terms of any
 * dependent transforms.
 *
 * @section yarn_object_templates_exapnder_1 Transformation
 *
 * The object templates expander only touches two types of model
 * elements: object templates and objects. This is because these are
 * the only two elements involved in relationships that deal with
 * object templates. Each of these are processed differently.
 *
 * @subsection yarn_object_templates_expander_11 First stage: expanding object templates
  *
 * The object templates transform starts by processing all object
 * templates. Each object template goes through two steps: @e
 * expansion and @e reduction. Expansion is defined as adding to each
 * inherited object template the set of all object templates implied
 * by the inheritance graph of that object template: that is, the
 * object template itself, the object templates that the object
 * template inherits from (lets call it @e parents), the object
 * templates that the parents inherits from and so on.
 *
 * Once the expansion is complete, reduction takes place: that is, all
 * duplicate object templates are removed. The final result is known
 * as the _reduced object templates set_.
 *
 * Note that we use the word @e set here in the mathematical sense, as
 * implementation-wise we use lists manage these relationships. This
 * is because we aim to preserve order where possible; this is to
 * avoid having the code generation move (potentially dramatically)
 * every time any alteration is done to the object templates
 * hierarchy.
 *
 * @subsection yarn_object_templates_expander_12 Second stage: expand objects
 *
 * The object templates expander is also responsible for updating the
 * instantiated object templates in an object - if any. Thus, only
 * objects that are part of such relationships are affected. For
 * example a child which does not instantiate any object templates is
 * not affected, even if its parent does instantiate object templates.
 *
 * Note that object expansion must be done after the object templates
 * expansion described above, as it depends on it.
 *
 * For objects which do not have parents, the operation is simple: for
 * a given object @e o, we just need to compute the reduced object
 * template set, as implied by the object templates it instantiates.
 *
 * For objects with parents things are slightly more complicated. We
 * must first compute the reduced object template set implied by all
 * its parents; this includes @e all instantiated object templates
 * found in the entirety of the inheritance graph of a given
 * object. Lets call that set @e P. We then take the set of all object
 * templates instantiated by the object directly (say @e R). The final
 * set of instantiated object templates for the object is given by the
 * set difference between @e R and @e S; that is, we remove all object
 * templates in @e R which are part of @e S - leaving those that only
 * exist in @e R but not in @e S.
