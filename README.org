* Overview

*Dogen* is a code generator designed to target domain models, inspired
by the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domain-driven_design][Domain Driven Design]] methodology. Our main objective is to
automate the modeling process as much as possible: the user creates
domain models using a supported uml tool and respecting a set of
predefined restrictions; Dogen then uses the tool's diagram files to
generate the source code representation. The generated code contains
most of the services required from a typical C++ domain object such as
serialisation, hashing, streaming and so on.

Please note that *the code generated by dogen is C++-11 only.*
